      "{\"title\": \"Citizen_Kane\", \"label\": \"Film\", \"text\": \"Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film produced by, directed by, and starring Orson Welles. He also co-wrote the screenplay with Herman J. Mankiewicz. The picture was Welles' first feature film. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is considered by many critics and experts to be the greatest film ever made. For 50 consecutive years, it stood at number 1 in the British Film Institute's \\\"Sight &amp; Sound\\\" decennial poll of critics, and it topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years\\u00a0... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as its 2007 update. The film was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories and it won for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Mankiewicz and Welles. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is praised for Gregg Toland's cinematography, Robert Wise's editing, Bernard Herrmann's music, and its narrative structure, all of which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.\\nThe quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a composite character based on American media barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, as well as aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited the film from being mentioned in his newspapers.\\nAfter the Broadway success of Welles's Mercury Theatre and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast \\\"The War of the Worlds\\\" on \\\"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\\\", Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939. Although it was unusual for an untried director, he was given freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have final cut privilege. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for \\\"Citizen Kane\\\", collaborating with Herman J. Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film was released in 1941.\\nAlthough it was a critical success, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but it returned to public attention when it was praised by French critics such as Andr\\u00e9 Bazin and re-released in 1956. The film was made available on Blu-ray on September 13, 2011, as a special 70th-anniversary edition. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was selected by the Library of Congress as an inductee of the 1989 inaugural group of 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\".\\nPlot.\\nIn a mansion called Xanadu, part of a vast palatial estate in Florida, the elderly Charles Foster Kane is on his deathbed. Holding a snow globe, he utters a word, \\\"Rosebud\\\", and dies. A newsreel obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher and industrial magnate. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of \\\"Rosebud\\\".\\nThompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach his second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns about Kane's rise from a Colorado boarding house and the decline of his personal fortune.\\nIn 1871, gold was discovered through a mining deed belonging to Kane's mother, Mary Kane. She hired Thatcher to establish a trust that would provide for Kane's education and to assume guardianship of him. While the parents and Thatcher discussed arrangements inside the boarding house, the young Kane played happily with a sled in the snow outside. When Kane's parents introduced him to Thatcher, the boy struck Thatcher with his sled and attempted to run away.\\nBy the time Kane gained control of his trust at the age of 25, the mine's productivity and Thatcher's prudent investing had made him one of the richest men in the world. He took control of the \\\"New York Inquirer\\\" newspaper and embarked on a career of yellow journalism, publishing scandalous articles that attacked Thatcher's (and his own) business interests. Kane sold his newspaper empire to Thatcher after the 1929 stock market crash left him short of cash.\\nThompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls that Kane hired the best journalists available to build the \\\"Inquirer\\\"s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the Spanish\\u2013American War and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of the President of the United States.\\nThompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a retirement home. Leland says that Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrated over the years, and he began an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while running for Governor of New York. Both his wife and his political opponent discovered the affair and the public scandal ended his political career. Kane married Susan and forced her into a humiliating operatic career for which she had neither the talent nor the ambition, even building a large opera house for her. After Leland began to write a negative review of Susan's opera debut, Kane fired him but finished the negative review and printed it.\\nSusan consents to an interview with Thompson and describes the aftermath of her opera career. Kane finally allowed her to abandon singing after she attempted suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, she left him. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan left him, he began violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. When he happened upon a snow globe, he grew calm and said \\\"Rosebud\\\". Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will forever remain a mystery.\\nBack at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are cataloged or discarded by the staff. They find the sled on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. They throw it with other junk into a furnace and, as it burns, the camera reveals its trade name, not noticed by the staff: \\\"Rosebud\\\".\\nCast.\\nThe beginning of the film's ending credits state that \\\"Most of the principal actors in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them.\\\" The cast is listed in the following order:\\nAdditionally, Charles Bennett appears as the entertainer at the head of the chorus line in the \\\"Inquirer\\\" party sequence, and cinematographer Gregg Toland makes a cameo appearance as an interviewer depicted in part of the \\\"News on the March\\\" newsreel. Actor Alan Ladd, still unknown at that time, makes a small appearance as a reporter smoking a pipe at the end of the film.\\nPre-production.\\nDevelopment.\\nHollywood had shown interest in Welles as early as 1936. He turned down three scripts sent to him by Warner Bros. In 1937, he declined offers from David O. Selznick, who asked him to head his film company's story department, and William Wyler, who wanted him for a supporting role in \\\"Wuthering Heights\\\". \\\"Although the possibility of making huge amounts of money in Hollywood greatly attracted him,\\\" wrote biographer Frank Brady, \\\"he was still totally, hopelessly, insanely in love with the theater, and it is there that he had every intention of remaining to make his mark.\\\"\\nFollowing \\\"The War of the Worlds\\\" broadcast of his CBS radio series \\\"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\\\", Welles was lured to Hollywood with a remarkable contract. RKO Pictures studio head George J. Schaefer wanted to work with Welles after the notorious broadcast, believing that Welles had a gift for attracting mass attention. RKO was also uncharacteristically profitable and was entering into a series of independent production contracts that would add more artistically prestigious films to its roster. Throughout the spring and early summer of 1939, Schaefer constantly tried to lure the reluctant Welles to Hollywood. Welles was in financial trouble after failure of his plays \\\"Five Kings\\\" and \\\"The Green Goddess\\\". At first he simply wanted to spend three months in Hollywood and earn enough money to pay his debts and fund his next theatrical season. Welles first arrived on July 20, 1939 and on his first tour, he called the movie studio \\\"the greatest electric train set a boy ever had\\\".\\nWelles signed his contract with RKO on August 21, which stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for the first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for a second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both projects' stories and so long as the budget did not exceed $500,000. RKO executives would not be allowed to see any footage until Welles chose to show it to them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles's approval. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the right of final cut. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles. Schaefer remained a great supporter and saw the unprecedented contract as good publicity. Film scholar Robert L. Carringer wrote: \\\"The simple fact seems to be that Schaefer believed Welles was going to pull off something really big almost as much as Welles did himself.\\\"\\nWelles spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get his first project going, without success. \\\"They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there,\\\" wrote \\\"The Hollywood Reporter\\\". It was agreed that Welles would film \\\"Heart of Darkness\\\", previously adapted for \\\"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\\\", which would be presented entirely through a first-person camera. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera\\u2014unheard of at the time\\u2014the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget. Schaefer told Welles that the $500,000 budget could not be exceeded; as war loomed, revenue was declining sharply in Europe by the fall of 1939.\\nHe then started work on the idea that became \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". Knowing the script would take time to prepare, Welles suggested to RKO that while that was being done\\u2014\\\"so the year wouldn't be lost\\\"\\u2014he make a humorous political thriller. Welles proposed \\\"The Smiler with a Knife\\\", from a novel by Cecil Day-Lewis. When that project stalled in December 1939, Welles began brainstorming other story ideas with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who had been writing Mercury radio scripts. \\\"Arguing, inventing, discarding, these two powerful, headstrong, dazzlingly articulate personalities thrashed toward \\\"Kane\\\"\\\", wrote biographer Richard Meryman.\\nScreenplay.\\nOne of the long-standing controversies about \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" has been the authorship of the screenplay. Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for Welles's CBS Radio series, \\\"The Campbell Playhouse\\\". Mankiewicz based the original outline on the life of William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.\\nIn February 1940 Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of John Houseman, Welles's former partner in the Mercury Theatre. Welles later explained, \\\"I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine.\\\" Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, \\\"At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all\\u2014who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.\\\"\\nThe terms of the contract stated that Mankiewicz was to receive no credit for his work, as he was hired as a script doctor. Before he signed the contract Mankiewicz was particularly advised by his agents that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the \\\"author and creator\\\". As the film neared release, however, Mankiewicz began wanting a writing credit for the film and even threatened to take out full-page ads in trade papers and to get his friend Ben Hecht to write an expos\\u00e9 for \\\"The Saturday Evening Post\\\". Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the Screen Writers Guild and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself.\\nAfter lodging a protest with the Screen Writers Guild, Mankiewicz withdrew it, then vacillated. The question was resolved in January 1941 when the studio, RKO Pictures, awarded Mankiewicz credit. The guild credit form listed Welles first, Mankiewicz second. Welles's assistant Richard Wilson said that the person who circled Mankiewicz's name in pencil, then drew an arrow that put it in first place, was Welles. The official credit reads, \\\"Screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles\\\". Mankiewicz's rancor toward Welles grew over the remaining 12 years of his life.\\nQuestions over the authorship of the \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" screenplay were revived in 1971 by influential film critic Pauline Kael, whose controversial 50,000-word essay \\\"Raising Kane\\\" was commissioned as an introduction to the shooting script in \\\"The Citizen Kane Book\\\", published in October 1971. The book-length essay first appeared in February 1971, in two consecutive issues of \\\"The New Yorker\\\" magazine.\\nIn the ensuing controversy, Welles was defended by colleagues, critics, biographers and scholars, but his reputation was damaged by its charges. The essay's thesis was later questioned and some of Kael's findings were also contested in later years.\\nQuestions of authorship continued to come into sharper focus with Carringer's 1978 thoroughly-researched essay, \\\"The Scripts of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\"\\\". Carringer studied the collection of script records\\u2014\\\"almost a day-to-day record of the history of the scripting\\\"\\u2014that was then still intact at RKO. He reviewed all seven drafts and concluded that \\\"the full evidence reveals that Welles's contribution to the \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" script was not only substantial but definitive.\\\"\\nSources.\\nWelles never confirmed a principal source for the character of Charles Foster Kane. Houseman wrote that Kane is a synthesis of different personalities, with Hearst's life used as the main source. Some events and details were invented, and Houseman wrote that he and Mankiewicz also \\\"grafted anecdotes from other giants of journalism, including Pulitzer, Northcliffe and Mank's first boss, Herbert Bayard Swope.\\\" Welles said, \\\"Mr. Hearst was quite a bit like Kane, although Kane isn't really founded on Hearst in particular. Many people sat for it, so to speak\\\". He specifically acknowledged that aspects of Kane were drawn from the lives of two business tycoons familiar from his youth in Chicago\\u2014Samuel Insull and Harold Fowler McCormick.\\nThe character of Jedediah Leland was based on drama critic Ashton Stevens, George Stevens's uncle and Welles's close boyhood friend. Some detail came from Mankiewicz's own experience as a drama critic in New York.\\nMany assumed that the character of Susan Alexander Kane was based on Marion Davies, Hearst's mistress whose career he managed and whom Hearst promoted as a motion picture actress. This assumption was a major reason Hearst tried to destroy \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". Welles denied that the character was based on Davies, whom he called \\\"an extraordinary woman\\u2014nothing like the character Dorothy Comingore played in the movie.\\\" He cited Insull's building of the Chicago Opera House, and McCormick's lavish promotion of the opera career of his second wife, Ganna Walska, as direct influences on the screenplay.\\nAs a known supporter of President Roosevelt, whom both McCormick and Hearst opposed based on his successful attempts to control the content of radio programs and his ongoing efforts to control print, Welles may have had incentive to use the film to smear both men.\\nThe character of political boss Jim W. Gettys is based on Charles F. Murphy, a leader in New York City's infamous Tammany Hall political machine.\\nWelles credited \\\"Rosebud\\\" to Mankiewicz. Biographer Richard Meryman wrote that the symbol of Mankiewicz's own damaged childhood was a treasured bicycle, stolen while he visited the public library and not replaced by his family as punishment. He regarded it as the prototype of Charles Foster Kane's sled. In his 2015 Welles biography, Patrick McGilligan reported that Mankiewicz himself stated that the word \\\"Rosebud\\\" was taken from the name of a famous racehorse, Old Rosebud. Mankiewicz had a bet on the horse in the 1914 Kentucky Derby, which he won, and McGilligan wrote that \\\"Old Rosebud symbolized his lost youth, and the break with his family\\\". In testimony for the Lundberg suit, Mankiewicz said, \\\"I had undergone psycho-analysis, and Rosebud, under circumstances slightly resembling the circumstances in [\\\"Citizen Kane\\\"], played a prominent part.\\\"\\nThe \\\"News on the March\\\" sequence that begins the film satirizes the journalistic style of \\\"The March of Time\\\", the news documentary and dramatization series presented in movie theaters by Time Inc. From 1935 to 1938 Welles was a member of the uncredited company of actors that presented the original radio version.\\nHouseman claimed that banker Walter P. Thatcher was loosely based on J. P. Morgan. Bernstein was named for Dr. Maurice Bernstein, appointed Welles's guardian; Sloane's portrayal was said to be based on Bernard Herrmann. Herbert Carter, editor of \\\"The Inquirer\\\", was named for actor Jack Carter.\\nProduction.\\nCasting.\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was a rare film in that its principal roles were played by actors new to motion pictures. Ten were billed as Mercury Actors, members of the skilled repertory company assembled by Welles for the stage and radio performances of the Mercury Theatre, an independent theater company he founded with Houseman in 1937. \\\"He loved to use the Mercury players,\\\" wrote biographer Charles Higham, \\\"and consequently he launched several of them on movie careers.\\\"\\nThe film represents the feature film debuts of William Alland, Ray Collins, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Erskine Sanford, Everett Sloane, Paul Stewart, and Welles himself. Despite never having appeared in feature films, some of the cast members were already well known to the public. Cotten had recently become a Broadway star in the hit play \\\"The Philadelphia Story\\\" with Katharine Hepburn and Sloane was well known for his role on the radio show \\\"The Goldbergs\\\". Mercury actor George Coulouris was a star of the stage in New York and London.\\nNot all of the cast came from the Mercury Players. Welles cast Dorothy Comingore, an actress who played supporting parts in films since 1934 using the name \\\"Linda Winters\\\", as Susan Alexander Kane. A discovery of Charlie Chaplin, Comingore was recommended to Welles by Chaplin, who then met Comingore at a party in Los Angeles and immediately cast her.\\nWelles had met stage actress Ruth Warrick while visiting New York on a break from Hollywood and remembered her as a good fit for Emily Norton Kane, later saying that she looked the part. Warrick told Carringer that she was struck by the extraordinary resemblance between herself and Welles's mother when she saw a photograph of Beatrice Ives Welles. She characterized her own personal relationship with Welles as motherly.\\n\\\"He trained us for films at the same time that he was training himself,\\\" recalled Agnes Moorehead. \\\"Orson believed in good acting, and he realized that rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors. That was something new in Hollywood: nobody seemed interested in bringing in a group to rehearse before scenes were shot. But Orson knew it was necessary, and we rehearsed every sequence before it was shot.\\\"\\nWhen \\\"The March of Time\\\" narrator Westbrook Van Voorhis asked for $25,000 to narrate the \\\"News on the March\\\" sequence, Alland demonstrated his ability to imitate Van Voorhis and Welles cast him.\\nWelles later said that casting character actor Gino Corrado in the small part of the waiter at the El Rancho broke his heart. Corrado had appeared in many Hollywood films, often as a waiter, and Welles wanted all of the actors to be new to films.\\nOther uncredited roles went to Thomas A. Curran as Teddy Roosevelt in the faux newsreel; Richard Baer as Hillman, a man at Madison Square Garden, and a man in the \\\"News on the March\\\" screening room; and Alan Ladd, Arthur O'Connell and Louise Currie as reporters at Xanadu.\\nRuth Warrick (died 2005) was the last surviving member of the principal cast. Sonny Bupp (died 2007), who played Kane's young son, was the last surviving credited cast member. Kathryn Trosper Popper (died March 6, 2016) was reported to have been the last surviving actor to have appeared in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". Jean Forward (died September 2016), a soprano who dubbed the singing voice of Susan Alexander, was the last surviving performer from the film.\\nFilming.\\nProduction advisor Miriam Geiger quickly compiled a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to \\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\\", which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, Ren\\u00e9 Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's \\\"Stagecoach\\\", which he watched 40 times. \\\"As it turned out, the first day I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director,\\\" Welles said. \\\"I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room\\u2014from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run \\\"Stagecoach\\\", often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school.\\\"\\nWelles's cinematographer for the film was Gregg Toland, described by Welles as \\\"just then, the number-one cameraman in the world.\\\" To Welles's astonishment, Toland visited him at his office and said, \\\"I want you to use me on your picture.\\\" He had seen some of the Mercury stage productions (including \\\"Caesar\\\") and said he wanted to work with someone who had never made a movie. RKO hired Toland on loan from Samuel Goldwyn Productions in the first week of June 1940.\\n\\\"And he never tried to impress us that he was doing any miracles,\\\" Welles recalled. \\\"I was calling for things only a beginner would have been ignorant enough to think anybody could ever do, and there he was, \\\"doing\\\" them.\\\" Toland later explained that he wanted to work with Welles because he anticipated the first-time director's inexperience and reputation for audacious experimentation in the theater would allow the cinematographer to try new and innovative camera techniques that typical Hollywood films would never have allowed him to do. Unaware of filmmaking protocol, Welles adjusted the lights on set as he was accustomed to doing in the theater; Toland quietly re-balanced them, and was angry when one of the crew informed Welles that he was infringing on Toland's responsibilities. During the first few weeks of June, Welles had lengthy discussions about the film with Toland and art director Perry Ferguson in the morning, and in the afternoon and evening he worked with actors and revised the script.\\nOn June 29, 1940\\u2014a Saturday morning when few inquisitive studio executives would be around\\u2014Welles began filming \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". After the disappointment of having \\\"Heart of Darkness\\\" canceled, Welles followed Ferguson's suggestion and deceived RKO into believing that he was simply shooting camera tests. \\\"But we were shooting the \\\"picture\\\",\\\" Welles said, \\\"because we wanted to get started and be already into it before anybody knew about it.\\\"\\nAt the time RKO executives were pressuring him to agree to direct a film called \\\"The Men from Mars\\\", to capitalize on \\\"The War of the Worlds\\\" radio broadcast. Welles said that he would consider making the project but wanted to make a different film first. At this time he did not inform them that he had already begun filming \\\"Citizen Kane.\\\"\\nThe early footage was called \\\"Orson Welles Tests\\\" on all paperwork. The first \\\"test\\\" shot was the \\\"News on the March\\\" projection room scene, economically filmed in a real studio projection room in darkness that masked many actors who appeared in other roles later in the film. \\\"At $809 Orson did run substantially beyond the test budget of $528\\u2014to create one of the most famous scenes in movie history,\\\" wrote Barton Whaley.\\nThe next scenes were the El Rancho nightclub scenes and the scene in which Susan attempts suicide. Welles later said that the nightclub set was available after another film had wrapped and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete. For these scenes Welles had Comingore's throat sprayed with chemicals to give her voice a harsh, raspy tone. Other scenes shot in secret included those in which Thompson interviews Leland and Bernstein, which were also shot on sets built for other films.\\nDuring production, the film was referred to as \\\"RKO 281\\\". Most of the filming took place in what is now Stage 19 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood. There was some location filming at Balboa Park in San Diego and the San Diego Zoo.\\nIn the end of July, RKO approved the film and Welles was allowed to officially begin shooting, despite having already been filming \\\"tests\\\" for several weeks. Welles leaked stories to newspaper reporters that the tests had been so good that there was no need to re-shoot them. The first official scene to be shot was the breakfast montage sequence between Kane and his first wife Emily. To strategically save money and appease the RKO executives who opposed him, Welles rehearsed scenes extensively before actually shooting and filmed very few takes of each shot set-up. Welles never shot master shots for any scene after Toland told him that Ford never shot them. To appease the increasingly curious press, Welles threw a cocktail party for selected reporters, promising that they could watch a scene being filmed. When the journalists arrived Welles told them they had \\\"just finished\\\" shooting for the day but still had the party. Welles told the press that he was ahead of schedule (without factoring in the month of \\\"test shooting\\\"), thus discrediting claims that after a year in Hollywood without making a film he was a failure in the film industry.\\nWelles usually worked 16 to 18 hours a day on the film. He often began work at 4\\u00a0a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this time to discuss the day's shooting with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom. While shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at Gettys on the stairs of Susan Alexander's apartment building, Welles fell ten feet; an X-ray revealed two bone chips in his ankle.\\nThe injury required him to direct the film from a wheelchair for two weeks. He eventually wore a steel brace to resume performing on camera; it is visible in the low-angle scene between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. For the final scene, a stage at the Selznick studio was equipped with a working furnace, and multiple takes were required to show the sled being put into the fire and the word \\\"Rosebud\\\" consumed. Paul Stewart recalled that on the ninth take the Culver City Fire Department arrived in full gear because the furnace had grown so hot the flue caught fire. \\\"Orson was delighted with the commotion\\\", he said.\\nWhen \\\"Rosebud\\\" was burned, Welles choreographed the scene while he had composer Bernard Herrmann's cue playing on the set.\\nUnlike Schaefer, many members of RKO's board of governors did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him. However such board members as Nelson Rockefeller and NBC chief David Sarnoff were sympathetic to Welles. Throughout production Welles had problems with these executives not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived on set to report what they saw to the executives. When the executives would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the executives intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.\\nPrincipal shooting wrapped October 24. Welles then took several weeks away from the film for a lecture tour, during which he also scouted additional locations with Toland and Ferguson. Filming resumed November 15 with some re-shoots. Toland had to leave due to a commitment to shoot Howard Hughes' \\\"The Outlaw\\\", but Toland's camera crew continued working on the film and Toland was replaced by RKO cinematographer Harry J. Wild. The final day of shooting on November 30 was Kane's death scene. Welles boasted that he only went 21 days over his official shooting schedule, without factoring in the month of \\\"camera tests\\\". According to RKO records, the film cost $839,727. Its estimated budget had been $723,800.\\nPost-production.\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was edited by Robert Wise and assistant editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the \\\"camera tests\\\" and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles \\\"had an older editor assigned to him for those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits.\\\" Wise and Robson began editing the film while it was still shooting and said that they \\\"could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out.\\\"\\nWelles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film \\\"in camera\\\" by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct \\\"timing\\\" and \\\"rhythm\\\" for the whip pans and overlapping dialogue. The \\\"News on the March\\\" sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Path\\u00e9 News and the General Film Library.\\nDuring post-production Welles and special effects artist Linwood G. Dunn experimented with an optical printer to improve certain scenes that Welles found unsatisfactory from the footage. Whereas Welles was often immediately pleased with Wise's work, he would require Dunn and post-production audio engineer James G. Stewart to re-do their work several times until he was satisfied.\\nWelles hired Bernard Herrmann to compose the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in as few as two or three weeks after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had sufficient time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.\\nTrailer.\\nWritten and directed by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" differs from other trailers in that it did not feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary piece on the film's production. Filmed at the same time as \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.\\nAt the time, it was almost unprecedented for a film trailer to not actually feature anything of the film itself; and while \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is frequently cited as a groundbreaking, influential film, Simon Callow argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has \\\"great playful charm\\u00a0... it is a miniature documentary, almost an introduction to the cinema\\u00a0... Teasing, charming, completely original, it is a sort of conjuring trick: Without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [sic] minutes' duration.\\\"\\nStyle.\\nFilm scholars and historians view \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" as Welles's attempt to create a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of it and combining them into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started working on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, \\\"Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance\\u2014you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful.\\\"\\nDavid Bordwell wrote that \\\"The best way to understand \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is to stop worshipping it as a triumph of technique.\\\" Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, and that many of these stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as \\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\\". But Bordwell asserts that the film did put them all together for the first time and perfected the medium in one single film. In a 1948 interview, D. W. Griffith said, \\\"I loved \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" and particularly loved the ideas he took from me.\\\"\\nArguments against the film's cinematic innovations were made as early as 1946 when French historian Georges Sadoul wrote, \\\"The film is an encyclopedia of old techniques.\\\" He pointed out such examples as compositions that used both the foreground and the background in the films of Auguste and Louis Lumi\\u00e8re, special effects used in the films of Georges M\\u00e9li\\u00e8s, shots of the ceiling in Erich von Stroheim's \\\"Greed\\\" and newsreel montages in the films of Dziga Vertov.\\nFrench film critic Andr\\u00e9 Bazin defended the film, writing: \\\"In this respect, the accusation of plagiarism could very well be extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide.\\\" Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumi\\u00e8re's cinematography since \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" used more sophisticated lenses, but acknowledged that it had similarities to such previous works as \\\"The 49th Parallel\\\" and \\\"The Power and the Glory\\\". Bazin stated that \\\"even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\", one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their \\\"meaning\\\".\\\" Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believed that the film's use of special effects contradicted some of Bazin's theories.\\nStorytelling techniques.\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\" rejects the traditional linear, chronological narrative and tells Kane's story entirely in flashbacks using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life, a technique not used previously in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story overlapping another. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.\\nThe technique of flashbacks had been used in earlier films, notably \\\"The Power and the Glory\\\" (1933), but no film was as immersed in it as \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". Thompson the reporter acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.\\nFilms typically had an \\\"omniscient perspective\\\" at the time, which Marilyn Fabe says give the audience the \\\"illusion that we are looking with impunity into a world which is unaware of our gaze\\\". \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" also begins in that fashion until the \\\"News on the March\\\" sequence, after which we the audience see the film through the perspectives of others. The \\\"News on the March\\\" sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) at the beginning of the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of wondering how it will end. Instead, the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext of finding out what \\\"Rosebud\\\" means. The film then returns to the omniscient perspective in the final scene, when only the audience discovers what \\\"Rosebud\\\" is.\\nCinematography.\\nThe most innovative technical aspect of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is the extended use of deep focus, where the foreground, background, and everything in between are all in sharp focus. Cinematographer Toland did this through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Toland described the achievement in an article for \\\"Theatre Arts\\\" magazine, made possible by the sensitivity of modern speed film:\\nNew developments in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced stage of the game but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed \\\"Pan-focus\\\", as I have been active for two years in its development and used it for the first time in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.\\nAnother unorthodox method used in the film was the low-angle shots facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Every set was built with a ceiling which broke with studio convention, and many were constructed of fabric that concealed microphones. Welles felt that the camera should show what the eye sees, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend that there was no ceiling\\u2014\\\"a big lie in order to get all those terrible lights up there,\\\" he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look interesting. One extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.\\nWelles credited Toland on the same title card as himself. \\\"It's impossible to say how much I owe to Gregg,\\\" he said. \\\"He was superb.\\\" He called Toland \\\"the best director of photography that ever existed.\\\"\\nSound.\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\"s sound was recorded by Bailey Fesler and re-recorded in post-production by audio engineer James G. Stewart, both of whom had worked in radio. Stewart said that Hollywood films never deviated from a basic pattern of how sound could be recorded or used, but with Welles \\\"deviation from the pattern was possible because he demanded it.\\\" Although the film is known for its complex soundtrack, much of the audio is heard as it was recorded by Fesler and without manipulation.\\nWelles used techniques from radio like overlapping dialogue. The scene in which characters sing \\\"Oh, Mr. Kane\\\" was especially complicated and required mixing several soundtracks together. He also used different \\\"sound perspectives\\\" to create the illusion of distances, such as in scenes at Xanadu where characters speak to each other at far distances. Welles experimented with sound in post-production, creating audio montages, and chose to create all of the sound effects for the film instead of using RKO's library of sound effects.\\nWelles used an aural technique from radio called the \\\"lightning-mix\\\". Welles used this technique to link complex montage sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into a young man in just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene. The film's sound cost $16,996, but was originally budgeted at $7,288.\\nFilm critic and director Fran\\u00e7ois Truffaut wrote that \\\"Before \\\"Kane\\\", nobody in Hollywood knew how to set music properly in movies. \\\"Kane\\\" was the first, in fact the only, great film that uses radio techniques.\\u00a0... A lot of filmmakers know enough to follow Auguste Renoir's advice to fill the eyes with images at all costs, but only Orson Welles understood that the sound track had to be filled in the same way.\\\" Cedric Belfrage of \\\"The Clipper\\\" wrote \\\"of all of the delectable flavours that linger on the palate after seeing \\\"Kane\\\", the use of sound is the strongest.\\\"\\nMake-up.\\nThe make-up for \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was created and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907\\u20131989), a junior member of the RKO make-up department. He had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors. \\\"Apprentices were not supposed to make up any principals, only extras, and an apprentice could not be on a set without a journeyman present,\\\" wrote make-up artist Dick Smith, who became friends with Seiderman in 1979. \\\"During his years at RKO I suspect these rules were probably overlooked often.\\\" \\\"Seiderman had gained a reputation as one of the most inventive and creatively precise up-and-coming makeup men in Hollywood,\\\" wrote biographer Frank Brady.\\nOn an early tour of RKO, Welles met Seiderman in the small make-up lab that he created for himself in an unused dressing room. \\\"Welles fastened on to him at once,\\\" wrote biographer Charles Higham, as Seiderman had developed his own makeup methods \\\"that ensured complete naturalness of expression\\u2014a naturalness unrivaled in Hollywood.\\\" Seiderman developed a thorough plan for aging the principal characters, first making a plaster cast of the face of each of the actors who aged. He made a plaster mold of Welles's body down to the hips.\\n\\\"My sculptural techniques for the characters' aging were handled by adding pieces of white modeling clay, which matched the plaster, onto the surface of each bust,\\\" Seiderman told Norman Gambill. When Seiderman achieved the desired effect, he cast the clay pieces in a soft plastic material that he formulated himself. These appliances were then placed onto the plaster bust and a four-piece mold was made for each phase of aging. The castings were then fully painted and paired with the appropriate wig for evaluation.\\nBefore the actors went before the cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied directly to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound; The red ground resulted in a warmth of tone that was picked up by the panchromatic film. Over that was applied liquid grease paint, and finally a colorless translucent talcum. Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast made from an orange peel.\\nWelles often arrived on the set at 2:30\\u00a0am, as application of the sculptural make-up took 3\\u00bd hours for the oldest incarnation of Kane. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast, and stomach. \\\"In the film and production photographs, you can see that Kane had a belly that overhung,\\\" Seiderman said. \\\"That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way.\\\"\\nSeiderman worked with Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a flexible skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When he found the wigs too full, he untied one hair at a time to alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture. He also made scleral lenses for Welles, Dorothy Comingore, George Coulouris, and Everett Sloane to dull the brightness of their young eyes. The lenses took a long time to fit properly, and Seiderman began work on them before devising any of the other makeup. \\\"I painted them to age in phases, ending with the blood vessels and the \\\"arcus senilis\\\" of old age.\\\" Seiderman's tour de force was the breakfast montage, shot all in one day. \\\"Twelve years, two years shot at each scene,\\\" he said.\\nThe major studios gave screen credit for make-up only to the department head. When RKO make-up department head Mel Berns refused to share credit with Seiderman, who was only an apprentice, Welles told Berns that there would be no make-up credit. Welles signed a large advertisement in the Los Angeles newspaper:\\nTHANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO GETS SCREEN CREDIT FOR \\\"CITIZEN KANE\\\"AND THANKS TO THOSE WHO DON'TTO ALL THE ACTORS, THE CREW, THE OFFICE, THE MUSICIANS, EVERYBODYAND PARTICULARLY TO MAURICE SEIDERMAN, THE BEST MAKE-UP MAN IN THE WORLD\\nSets.\\nAlthough credited as an assistant, the film's art direction was done by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design was an integral part of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.\\nIn the original script the Great Hall at Xanadu was modeled after the Great Hall in Hearst Castle and its design included a mixture of Renaissance and Gothic styles. \\\"The Hearstian element is brought out in the almost perverse juxtaposition of incongruous architectural styles and motifs,\\\" wrote Carringer. Before RKO cut the film's budget, Ferguson's designs were more elaborate and resembled the production designs of early Cecil B. DeMille films and \\\"Intolerance\\\". The budget cuts reduced Ferguson's budget by 33 percent and his work cost $58,775 total, which was below average at that time.\\nTo save costs Ferguson and Welles re-wrote scenes in Xanadu's living room and transported them to the Great Hall. A large staircase from another film was found and used at no additional cost. When asked about the limited budget, Ferguson said \\\"Very often\\u2014as in that much-discussed 'Xanadu' set in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\"\\u2014we can make a foreground piece, a background piece, and imaginative lighting suggests a great deal more on the screen than actually exists on the stage.\\\" According to the film's official budget there were 81 sets built, but Ferguson said there were between 106 and 116.\\nStill photographs of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, were used in the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.\\nSpecial effects.\\nThe film's special effects were supervised by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene in which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.\\nSome shots included rear screen projection in the background, such as Thompson's interview of Leland and some of the ocean backgrounds at Xanadu. Bordwell claims that the scene where Thatcher agrees to be Kane's guardian used rear screen projection to depict young Kane in the background, despite this scene being cited as a prime example of Toland's deep focus cinematography. A special effects camera crew from Walker's department was required for the extreme close-up shots such as Kane's lips when he says \\\"Rosebud\\\" and the shot of the typewriter typing Susan's bad review.\\nOptical effects artist Dunn claimed that \\\"up to 80 percent of some reels was optically printed.\\\" These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years. The optical printer improved some of the deep focus shots. One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive graininess, such as the optical zoom out of the snow globe. Welles decided to superimpose snow falling to mask the graininess in these shots. Toland said that he disliked the results of the optical printer, but acknowledged that \\\"RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production\\u2014a by no means inconsiderable assignment\\u2014with ability and fine understanding.\\\"\\nAny time deep focus was impossible\\u2014as in the scene in which Kane finishes a negative review of Susan's opera while at the same time firing the person who began writing the review\\u2014an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.\\nMusic.\\nThe film's music was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann had composed for Welles for his Mercury Theatre radio broadcasts. Because it was Herrmann's first motion picture score, RKO wanted to pay him only a small fee, but Welles insisted he be paid at the same rate as Max Steiner.\\nThe score established Herrmann as an important new composer of film soundtracks and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as \\\"radio scoring\\\", musical cues typically 5\\u201315 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as the passage of time leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.\\nHerrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotif played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.\\nFor Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles suggested that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a Mary Garden vehicle, an aria from \\\"Salammb\\u00f4\\\". \\\"Our problem was to create something that would give the audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but small voice, is suddenly thrown,\\\" Herrmann said. Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera, Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander. Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore. Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on Jean Racine's \\\"Athalie\\\" and \\\"Phedre\\\", although some confusion remains since Lucille Fletcher remembered preparing the lyrics. Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera \\\"Wuthering Heights\\\".\\nMusic enthusiasts consider the scene in which Susan Alexander Kane attempts to sing the famous cavatina \\\"Una voce poco fa\\\" from \\\"Il barbiere di Siviglia\\\" by Gioachino Rossini with vocal coach Signor Matiste as especially memorable for depicting the horrors of learning music through mistakes.\\nIn 1972, Herrmann said, \\\"I was fortunate to start my career with a film like \\\"Citizen Kane\\\", it's been a downhill run ever since!\\\" Welles loved Herrmann's score and told director Henry Jaglom that it was 50 percent responsible for the film's artistic success.\\nSome incidental music came from other sources. Welles heard the tune used for the publisher's theme, \\\"Oh, Mr. Kane\\\", in Mexico. Called \\\"A Poco No\\\", the song was written by Pepe Gu\\u00edzar and special lyrics were written by Herman Ruby.\\n\\\"In a Mizz\\\", a 1939 jazz song by Charlie Barnet and Haven Johnson, bookends Thompson's second interview of Susan Alexander Kane. \\\"I kind of based the whole scene around that song,\\\" Welles said. \\\"The music is by Nat Cole\\u2014it's his trio.\\\" Later\\u2014beginning with the lyrics, \\\"It can't be love\\\"\\u2014\\\"In a Mizz\\\" is performed at the Everglades picnic, framing the fight in the tent between Susan and Kane. Musicians including bandleader Cee Pee Johnson (drums), Alton Redd (vocals), Raymond Tate (trumpet), Buddy Collette (alto sax) and Buddy Banks (tenor sax) are featured.\\nAll of the music used in the newsreel came from the RKO music library, edited at Welles's request by the newsreel department to achieve what Herrmann called \\\"their own crazy way of cutting\\\". The \\\"News on the March\\\" theme that accompanies the newsreel titles is \\\"Belgian March\\\" by Anthony Collins, from the film \\\"Nurse Edith Cavell\\\". Other examples are an excerpt from Alfred Newman's score for \\\"Gunga Din\\\" (the exploration of Xanadu), Roy Webb's theme for the film \\\"Reno\\\" (the growth of Kane's empire), and bits of Webb's score for \\\"Five Came Back\\\" (introducing Walter Parks Thatcher).\\nEditing.\\nOne of the editing techniques used in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was the use of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time. Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene \\\"was stolen from \\\"The Long Christmas Dinner\\\" by Thornton Wilder\\u00a0... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life.\\\" The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.\\nWelles was influenced by the editing theories of Sergei Eisenstein by using jarring cuts that caused \\\"sudden graphic or associative contrasts\\\", such as the cut from Kane's deathbed to the beginning of the \\\"News on the March\\\" sequence and a sudden shot of a shrieking cockatoo at the beginning of Raymond's flashback. Although the film typically favors mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne over montage, the scene in which Kane goes to Susan Alexander's apartment after first meeting her is the only one that is primarily cut as close-ups with shots and counter shots between Kane and Susan. Fabe says that \\\"by using a standard Hollywood technique sparingly, [Welles] revitalizes its psychological expressiveness.\\\"\\nPolitical themes.\\nLaura Mulvey explored the anti-fascist themes of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" in her 1992 monograph for the British Film Institute. The \\\"News on the March\\\" newsreel presents Kane keeping company with Hitler and other dictators while he smugly assures the public that there will be no war. She wrote that the film reflects \\\"the battle between intervention and isolationism\\\" then being waged in the United States; the film was released six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt was laboring to win public opinion for entering World War II. \\\"In the rhetoric of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\",\\\" Mulvey writes, \\\"the destiny of isolationism is realised in metaphor: in Kane's own fate, dying wealthy and lonely, surrounded by the detritus of European culture and history.\\\"\\nJournalist Ignacio Ramonet has cited the film as an early example of mass media manipulation of public opinion and the power that media conglomerates have on influencing the democratic process. He believes that this early example of a media mogul influencing politics is outdated and that today \\\"there are media groups with the power of a thousand Citizen Kanes.\\\" Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is sometimes labeled as a latter-day \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". \\nComparisons have also been made between the career and character of Donald Trump and Charles Foster Kane. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is reported to be one of Trump's favorite films, and his biographer Tim O\\u2019Brien has said that Trump is fascinated by and identifies with Kane.\\nReception.\\nPre-release controversy.\\nTo ensure that Hearst's life's influence on \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was a secret, Welles limited access to dailies and managed the film's publicity. A December 1940 feature story in \\\"Stage\\\" magazine compared the film's narrative to \\\"Faust\\\" and made no mention of Hearst.\\nThe film was scheduled to premiere at RKO's flagship theater Radio City Music Hall on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941 for such magazines as \\\"Life\\\", \\\"Look\\\" and \\\"Redbook\\\". Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (an arch-rival of Louella Parsons, the Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a \\\"vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man\\\" and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography.\\n\\\"Friday\\\" magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons. Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she was so nice to him and that she should \\\"wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss.\\\" Welles immediately denied making the statement and the editor of \\\"Friday\\\" admitted that it might be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.\\nShortly after \\\"Friday\\\"s article, Hearst sent Parsons an angry letter complaining that he had learned about \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" from Hopper and not her. The incident made a fool of Parsons and compelled her to start attacking Welles and the film. Parsons demanded a private screening of the film and personally threatened Schaefer on Hearst's behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10 Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film. James G. Stewart was present at the screening and said that she walked out of the film.\\nSoon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released \\\"Kane\\\". She also contacted the management of Radio City Music Hall and demanded that they should not screen it. The next day, the front page headline in \\\"Daily Variety\\\" read, \\\"HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS.\\\" Hearst began this ban by suppressing promotion of RKO's \\\"Kitty Foyle\\\", but in two weeks the ban was lifted for everything except \\\"Kane.\\\"\\nWhen Schaefer did not submit to Parsons she called other studio heads and made more threats on behalf of Hearst to expose the private lives of people throughout the entire film industry. Welles was threatened with an expos\\u00e9 about his romance with the married actress Dolores del R\\u00edo, who wanted the affair kept secret until her divorce was finalized. In a statement to journalists Welles denied that the film was about Hearst. Hearst began preparing an injunction against the film for libel and invasion of privacy, but Welles's lawyer told him that he doubted Hearst would proceed due to the negative publicity and required testimony that an injunction would bring.\\n\\\"The Hollywood Reporter\\\" ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve \\\"Kane\\\". Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative.\\nOnce RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that \\\"Kane\\\" would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.\\nHearst's response.\\nHearing about \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing, or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists libel Welles. Welles used Hearst's opposition as a pretext for previewing the film in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging. A special press screening took place in early March. Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1\\u00a0million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A \\\"Hollywood Review\\\" headline read, \\\"Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture\\\". The \\\"Motion Picture Herald\\\" reported about the screening and Hearst's intention to sue RKO. \\\"Time\\\" magazine wrote that \\\"The objection of Mr. Hearst, who founded a publishing empire on sensationalism, is ironic. For to most of the several hundred people who have seen the film at private screenings, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is the most sensational product of the U.S. movie industry.\\\" A second press screening occurred in April.\\nWhen Schaefer rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing\\u2014or even mentioning\\u2014the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary \\\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\\" lays the blame for the film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason \\\"Kane\\\" failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.\\nHearst's attacks against Welles went beyond attempting to suppress the film. Welles said that while he was on his post-filming lecture tour a police detective approached him at a restaurant and advised him not to go back to his hotel. A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were waiting for him to walk in. Knowing he would be jailed after the resulting publicity, Welles did not return to the hotel but waited until the train left town the following morning. \\\"But that wasn't Hearst,\\\" Welles said, \\\"that was a hatchet man from the local Hearst paper who thought he would advance himself by doing it.\\\"\\nIn March 1941, Welles directed a Broadway version of Richard Wright's \\\"Native Son\\\" (and, for luck, used a \\\"Rosebud\\\" sled as a prop). \\\"Native Son\\\" received positive reviews, but Hearst-owned papers used the opportunity to attack Welles as a communist. The Hearst papers vociferously attacked Welles after his April 1941 radio play, \\\"His Honor, the Mayor\\\", produced for The Free Company radio series on CBS.\\nWelles described his chance encounter with Hearst in an elevator at the Fairmont Hotel on the night \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" opened in San Francisco. Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he would like to come to the opening. Hearst did not respond. \\\"As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply\\\", recalled Welles. \\\"And Kane would have, you know. That was his style\\u2014just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer.\\\"\\nIn 1945, Hearst journalist Robert Shaw wrote that the film got \\\"a full tide of insensate fury\\\" from Hearst papers, \\\"then it ebbed suddenly. With one brain cell working, the chief realized that such hysterical barking by the trained seals would attract too much attention to the picture. But to this day the name of Orson Welles is on the official son-of-a-bitch list of every Hearst newspaper.\\\"\\nDespite Hearst's attempts to destroy the film, since 1941 references to his life and career have usually included a reference to \\\"Citizen Kane\\\", such as the headline 'Son of Citizen Kane Dies' for the obituary of Hearst's son. In 2012, the Hearst estate agreed to screen the film at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, breaking Hearst's ban on the film.\\nRelease.\\nRadio City Music Hall's management refused to screen \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that \\\"The American Weekly\\\" would run a defamatory story on the grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller. Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst and refused to show the film. In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit if they did not release the film. Schaefer stood by Welles and opposed the board of governors. When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1\\u00a0million and the studio finally agreed to release the film on May 1.\\nSchaefer managed to book a few theaters willing to show the film. Hearst papers refused to accept advertising. RKO's publicity advertisements for the film erroneously promoted it as a love story.\\n\\\"Kane\\\" opened at the RKO Palace Theatre on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in Chicago on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8. Welles said that at the Chicago premiere that he attended the theater was almost empty. It did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles's film as part of a package but refused to play it, reportedly out of fear of Hearst. Hearst's disruption of the film's release damaged its box office performance and, as a result, it lost $160,000 during its initial run. The film earned $23,878 during its first week in New York. By the ninth week it only made $7,279. Overall it lost money in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., but made a profit in Seattle.\\nContemporary responses.\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\" received acclaim from several critics. \\\"New York Daily News\\\" critic Kate Cameron called it \\\"one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has ever come out of a Hollywood studio\\\". \\\"New York World-Telegram\\\" critic William Boehnel said that the film was \\\"staggering and belongs at once among the greatest screen achievements\\\". \\\"Time\\\" magazine wrote that \\\"it has found important new techniques in picture-making and story-telling.\\\" \\\"Life\\\" magazine's review said that \\\"few movies have ever come from Hollywood with such powerful narrative, such original technique, such exciting photography.\\\" John C. Mosher of \\\"The New Yorker\\\" called the film's style \\\"like fresh air\\\" and raved \\\"Something new has come to the movie world at last.\\\" Anthony Bower of \\\"The Nation\\\" called it \\\"brilliant\\\" and praised the cinematography and performances by Welles, Comingore and Cotten. John O'Hara's \\\"Newsweek\\\" review called it the best picture he'd ever seen and said Welles was \\\"the best actor in the history of acting.\\\" Welles called O'Hara's review \\\"the greatest review that anybody ever had.\\\"\\nThe day following the premiere of \\\"Citizen Kane,\\\" \\\"The New York Times\\\" critic Bosley Crowther wrote that \\\"...\\u00a0it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood.\\\"\\nCount on Mr. Welles: he doesn't do things by halves.\\u00a0... Upon the screen he discovered an area large enough for his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence is that he has made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.\\nIn the UK C. A. Lejeune of \\\"The Observer\\\" called it \\\"The most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood in twenty-five years\\\" and Dilys Powell of \\\"The Sunday Times\\\" said the film's style was made \\\"with the ease and boldness and resource of one who controls and is not controlled by his medium.\\\" Edward Tangye Lean of \\\"Horizon\\\" praised the film's technical style, calling it \\\"perhaps a decade ahead of its contemporaries.\\\"\\nA few reviews were mixed. Otis Ferguson of \\\"The New Republic\\\" said it was \\\"the boldest free-hand stroke in major screen production since Griffith and Bitzer were running wild to unshackle the camera\\\", but also criticized its style, calling it a \\\"retrogression in film technique\\\" and stating that \\\"it holds no great place\\\" in film history. Ferguson reacted to some of the film's celebrated visual techniques by calling them \\\"just willful dabbling\\\" and \\\"the old shell game.\\\" In a rare film review, filmmaker Erich von Stroheim criticized the film's story and non-linear structure, but praised the technical style and performances, and wrote \\\"Whatever the truth may be about it, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is a great picture and will go down in screen history. More power to Welles!\\\"\\nSome prominent critics wrote negative reviews. In his 1941 review for \\\"Sur\\\", Jorge Luis Borges famously called the film \\\"a labyrinth with no center\\\" and predicted that its legacy would be a film \\\"whose historical value is undeniable but which no one cares to see again.\\\" \\\"The Argus Weekend Magazine\\\" critic Erle Cox called the film \\\"amazing\\\" but thought that Welles's break with Hollywood traditions was \\\"overdone\\\". \\\"Tatler\\\"s James Agate called it \\\"the well-intentioned, muddled, amateurish thing one expects from high-brows\\\" and \\\"a quite good film which tries to run the psychological essay in harness with your detective thriller, and doesn't quite succeed.\\\" Eileen Creelman of \\\"The New York Sun\\\" called it \\\"a cold picture, unemotional, a puzzle rather than a drama\\\". Other people who disliked the film were W. H. Auden and James Agee. After watching the film on January 29, 1942 Kenneth Williams, then aged 15, writing in his first diary curtly described it as \\\"boshey rot\\\".\\nModern critics have given \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" an even more positive response. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 99% of 117 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 9.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\\"Orson Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in film.\\\" In April 2021, it was noted that the addition of an 80-year-old negative review from the \\\"Chicago Tribune\\\" reduced the film's rating from 100% to 99% on the site; \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" held its 100% rating until at least late February 2021. However, the film still has a rare weighted average score of 100 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 19 critics, indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\".\\nAccolades.\\nIt was widely believed the film would win most of its Academy Award nominations, but it received only the award for Best Original Screenplay. \\\"Variety\\\" reported that block voting by screen extras deprived \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" of Best Picture and Best Actor, and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.\\nLegacy.\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was the only film made under Welles's original contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO under which he produced and directed \\\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\\" (1942), produced \\\"Journey into Fear\\\" (1943), and began \\\"It's All True\\\", a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was an employee of the studio and lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut \\\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\\" over his objections. In June 1942, Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.\\nRelease in Europe.\\nDuring World War II, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was not seen in most European countries. It was shown in France for the first time on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theater in Paris. Initially most French film critics were influenced by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that \\\"the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas we all know that cinema has got to be in the present tense.\\\"\\nAndr\\u00e9 Bazin, a then little-known film critic working for Sartre's \\\"Les Temps modernes\\\", was asked to give an impromptu speech about the film after a screening at the Colis\\u00e9e Theatre in the autumn of 1946 and changed the opinion of much of the audience. This speech led to Bazin's 1947 article \\\"The Technique of Citizen Kane\\\", which directly influenced public opinion about the film. Carringer wrote that Bazin was \\\"the one who did the most to enhance the film's reputation.\\\" Both Bazin's critique of the film and his theories about cinema itself centered around his strong belief in mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne. These theories were diametrically opposed to both the popular Soviet montage theory and the politically Marxist and anti-Hollywood beliefs of most French film critics at that time. Bazin believed that a film should depict reality without the filmmaker imposing their \\\"will\\\" on the spectator, which the Soviet theory supported. Bazin wrote that \\\"Citizen Kane\\\"s mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne created a \\\"new conception of filmmaking\\\" and that the freedom given to the audience from the deep focus shots was innovative by changing the entire concept of the cinematic image. Bazin wrote extensively about the mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne in the scene where Susan Alexander attempts suicide, which was one long take while other films would have used four or five shots in the scene. Bazin wrote that the film's mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne \\\"forces the spectator to participate in the meaning of the film\\\" and creates \\\"a psychological realism which brings the spectator back to the real conditions of perception.\\\"\\nIn his 1950 essay \\\"The Evolution of the Language of Cinema\\\", Bazin placed \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" center stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema. One of the first critics to defend motion pictures as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, Bazin often used the film as an example of cinema as an art form and wrote that \\\"Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have.\\\" Bazin also compared the film to Roberto Rossellini's \\\"Paisan\\\" for having \\\"the same aesthetic concept of realism\\\" and to the films of William Wyler shot by Toland (such as \\\"The Little Foxes\\\" and \\\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\\"), all of which used deep focus cinematography that Bazin called \\\"a dialectical step forward in film language.\\\"\\nBazin's praise of the film went beyond film theory and reflected his own philosophy towards life itself. His metaphysical interpretations about the film reflected humankind's place in the universe. Bazin believed that the film examined one person's identity and search for meaning. It portrayed the world as ambiguous and full of contradictions, whereas films up until then simply portrayed people's actions and motivations. Bazin's biographer Dudley Andrew wrote that:\\nThe world of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\", that mysterious, dark, and infinitely deep world of space and memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.\\nBazin went on to co-found \\\"Cahiers du cin\\u00e9ma\\\", whose contributors (including future film directors Fran\\u00e7ois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard) also praised the film. The popularity of Truffaut's auteur theory helped the film's and Welles's reputation.\\nRe-evaluation.\\nBy 1942 \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished and both the film's and Welles's reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic Richard Griffith in his overview of cinema, \\\"The Film Till Now\\\", dismissed \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" as \\\"...\\u00a0tinpot if not crackpot Freud.\\\"\\nIn the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-to-late 1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States: first, RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television, and early that year \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" started to appear on television; second, the film was re-released theatrically to coincide with Welles's return to the New York stage, where he played \\\"King Lear\\\"; and third, American film critic Andrew Sarris wrote \\\"Citizen Kane: The American Baroque\\\" for \\\"Film Culture\\\", and described it as \\\"the great American film\\\" and \\\"the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since \\\"The Birth of a Nation\\\".\\\" Carringer considers Sarris's essay as the most important influence on the film's reputation in the US.\\nDuring Expo 58, a poll of over 100 film historians named \\\"Kane\\\" one of the top ten greatest films ever made (the group gave first-place honors to \\\"Battleship Potemkin\\\"). When a group of young film directors announced their vote for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.\\nIn the decades since, its critical status as the greatest film ever made has grown, with numerous essays and books on it including Peter Cowie's \\\"The Cinema of Orson Welles\\\", Ronald Gottesman's \\\"Focus on Citizen Kane\\\", a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, \\\"Raising Kane\\\", which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before. Despite its criticism of Welles, it further popularized the notion of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" as the great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery. David Thomson said that the film 'grows with every year as America comes to resemble it.\\\"\\nThe British magazine \\\"Sight &amp; Sound\\\" has produced a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952, and is regarded as one of the most respected barometers of critical taste. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll, retaining the top spot in every subsequent poll until 2012, when \\\"Vertigo\\\" displaced it.\\nThe film has also ranked number one in the following film \\\"best of\\\" lists: Julio Castedo's \\\"The 100 Best Films of the Century\\\", Cahiers du cin\\u00e9ma's 100 films pour une cin\\u00e9math\\u00e8que id\\u00e9ale, \\\"Kinovedcheskie Zapiski\\\", \\\"Time Out\\\" magazine's Top 100 Films (Centenary), \\\"The Village Voice\\\"s 100 Greatest Films, and The Royal Belgian Film Archive's Most Important and Misappreciated American Films.\\nRoger Ebert called \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" the greatest film ever made: \\\"But people don't always ask about the greatest film. They ask, 'What's your favorite movie?' Again, I always answer with \\\"Citizen Kane\\\".\\\"\\nIn 1998 \\\"Time Out\\\" conducted a reader's poll and \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was voted 3rd best film of all time. On February 18, 1999, the United States Postal Service honored \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" by including it in its Celebrate the Century series. The film was honored again February 25, 2003, in a series of U.S. postage stamps marking the 75th anniversary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Art director Perry Ferguson represents the behind-the-scenes craftsmen of filmmaking in the series; he is depicted completing a sketch for \\\"Citizen Kane\\\".\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was ranked number one in the American Film Institute's polls of film industry artists and leaders in 1998 and 2007. \\\"Rosebud\\\" was chosen as the 17th most memorable movie quotation in a 2005 AFI poll. The film's score was one of 250 nominees for the top 25 film scores in American cinema in another 2005 AFI poll. In 2005 the film was included on \\\"Time\\\"s All-Time 100 best movies list.\\nIn 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild published a list of the 75 best-edited films of all time based on a survey of its membership. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was listed second. In 2015, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" ranked 1st on BBC's \\\"100 Greatest American Films\\\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.\\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 99% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 116 reviews by approved critics, with an average rating of 9.70/10. The website's critics consensus states: \\\"Orson Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in film.\\\" On another aggregator site, Metacritic, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" has a weighted average score of 100 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\".\\nInfluence.\\n\\\"Citizen Kane\\\" has been called the most influential film of all time. Richard Corliss has asserted that Jules Dassin's 1941 film \\\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\\" was the first example of its influence and the first pop culture reference to the film occurred later in 1941 when the spoof comedy \\\"Hellzapoppin\\\"' featured a \\\"Rosebud\\\" sled. The film's cinematography was almost immediately influential and in 1942 \\\"American Cinematographer\\\" wrote \\\"without a doubt the most immediately noticeable trend in cinematography methods during the year was the trend toward crisper definition and increased depth of field.\\\"\\nThe cinematography influenced John Huston's \\\"The Maltese Falcon\\\". Cinematographer Arthur Edeson used a wider-angle lens than Toland and the film includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, but it did not use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" did. Edeson and Toland are often credited together for revolutionizing cinematography in 1941. Toland's cinematography influenced his own work on \\\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\\". Other films influenced include \\\"Gaslight\\\", \\\"Mildred Pierce\\\" and \\\"Jane Eyre\\\". Cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa said that his use of deep focus was influenced by \\\"the camera work of Gregg Toland in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\"\\\" and not by traditional Japanese art.\\nIts cinematography, lighting, and flashback structure influenced such film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s as \\\"The Killers\\\", \\\"Keeper of the Flame\\\", \\\"Caught\\\", \\\"The Great Man\\\" and \\\"This Gun for Hire\\\". David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson have written that \\\"For over a decade thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements.\\\" However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and Cin\\u00e9ma v\\u00e9rit\\u00e9 movements favored \\\"flatter, more shallow images with softer focus\\\" and \\\"Citizen Kane\\\"s style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once. Its use of long takes influenced films such as \\\"The Asphalt Jungle\\\", and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced \\\"Gun Crazy\\\", \\\"The Whip Hand\\\", \\\"The Devil's General\\\" and \\\"Justice Is Done\\\". The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced \\\"La commare secca\\\" and \\\"Man of Marble\\\".\\nThe film's structure influenced the biographical films \\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\\" and \\\"\\\"\\u2014which begin with the subject's death and show their life in flashbacks\\u2014as well as Welles's thriller \\\"Mr. Arkadin\\\". Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to \\\"Mr. Arkadin\\\", as well as the theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" and including \\\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\\", \\\"Mr. Arkadin\\\" and \\\"Chimes at Midnight\\\". Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's \\\"Reds\\\". The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in \\\"Citizen Kane\\\".\\nAkira Kurosawa's \\\"Rashomon\\\" is often compared to the film due to both having complicated plot structures told by multiple characters in the film. Welles said his initial idea for the film was \\\"Basically, the idea \\\"Rashomon\\\" used later on,\\\" however Kurosawa had not yet seen the film before making \\\"Rashomon\\\" in 1950. Nigel Andrews has compared the film's complex plot structure to \\\"Rashomon\\\", \\\"Last Year at Marienbad\\\", \\\"Memento\\\" and \\\"Magnolia\\\". Andrews also compares Charles Foster Kane to Michael Corleone in \\\"The Godfather\\\", Jake LaMotta in \\\"Raging Bull\\\" and Daniel Plainview in \\\"There Will Be Blood\\\" for their portrayals of \\\"haunted megalomaniac[s], presiding over the shards of [their] own [lives].\\\"\\nThe films of Paul Thomas Anderson have been compared to it. \\\"Variety\\\" compared \\\"There Will Be Blood\\\" to the film and called it \\\"one that rivals \\\"Giant\\\" and \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" in our popular lore as origin stories about how we came to be the people we are.\\\" \\\"The Master\\\" has been called \\\"movieland's only spiritual sequel to \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" that doesn't shrivel under the hefty comparison\\\". \\\"The Social Network\\\" has been compared to the film for its depiction of a media mogul and by the character Erica Albright being similar to \\\"Rosebud\\\". The controversy of the Sony hacking before the release of \\\"The Interview\\\" brought comparisons of Hearst's attempt to suppress the film. The film's plot structure and some specific shots influenced Todd Haynes's \\\"Velvet Goldmine\\\". Abbas Kiarostami's \\\"The Traveler\\\" has been called \\\"the \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" of the Iranian children's cinema.\\\" The film's use of overlapping dialogue has influenced the films of Robert Altman and Carol Reed. Reed's films \\\"Odd Man Out\\\", \\\"The Third Man\\\" (in which Welles and Cotten appeared) and \\\"Outcast of the Islands\\\" were also influenced by the film's cinematography.\\nMany directors have listed it as one of the greatest films ever made, including Woody Allen, Michael Apted, Les Blank, Kenneth Branagh, Paul Greengrass, Satyajit Ray, Michel Hazanavicius, Michael Mann, Sam Mendes, Ji\\u0159\\u00ed Menzel, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Denys Arcand, Gillian Armstrong, John Boorman, Roger Corman, Alex Cox, Milo\\u0161 Forman, Norman Jewison, Richard Lester, Richard Linklater, Paul Mazursky, Ronald Neame, Sydney Pollack and Stanley Kubrick. Yasujir\\u014d Ozu said it was his favorite non-Japanese film and was impressed by its techniques. Fran\\u00e7ois Truffaut said that the film \\\"has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout the world than any other\\\" and recognized its influence in \\\"The Barefoot Contessa\\\", \\\"Les Mauvaises Rencontres\\\", \\\"Lola Mont\\u00e8s\\\", and \\\"8 1/2\\\". Truffaut's \\\"Day for Night\\\" pays tribute to the film in a dream sequence depicting a childhood memory of the character played by Truffaut stealing publicity photos from the film. Numerous film directors have cited the film as influential on their own films, including Theo Angelopoulos, Luc Besson, the Coen brothers, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, John Frankenheimer, Stephen Frears, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese, Bryan Singer and Steven Spielberg. Ingmar Bergman disliked the film and called it \\\"a total bore. Above all, the performances are worthless. The amount of respect that movie has is absolutely unbelievable!\\\"\\nWilliam Friedkin said that the film influenced him and called it \\\"a veritable quarry for filmmakers, just as Joyce's \\\"Ulysses\\\" is a quarry for writers.\\\" The film has also influenced other art forms. Carlos Fuentes's novel \\\"The Death of Artemio Cruz\\\" was partially inspired by the film and the rock band The White Stripes paid unauthorized tribute to the film in the song \\\"The Union Forever\\\".\\nFilm memorabilia.\\nIn 1982, film director Steven Spielberg bought a \\\"Rosebud\\\" sled for $60,500; it was one of three balsa sleds used in the closing scenes and the only one that was not burned. After the Spielberg purchase, it was reported that retiree Arthur Bauer claimed to own another \\\"Rosebud\\\" sled. In early 1942, when Bauer was 12, he had won an RKO publicity contest and selected the hardwood sled as his prize. In 1996, Bauer's estate offered the painted pine sled at auction through Christie's. Bauer's son told CBS News that his mother had once wanted to paint the sled and use it as a plant stand, but Bauer told her to \\\"just save it and put it in the closet.\\\" The sled was sold to an anonymous bidder for $233,500.\\nWelles's Oscar for Best Original Screenplay was believed to be lost until it was rediscovered in 1994. It was withdrawn from a 2007 auction at Sotheby's when bidding failed to reach its estimate of $800,000 to $1.2\\u00a0million. Owned by the charitable Dax Foundation, it was auctioned for $861,542 in 2011 to an anonymous buyer. Mankiewicz's Oscar was sold at least twice, in 1999 and again in 2012, the latest price being $588,455.\\nIn 1989, Mankiewicz's personal copy of the \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" script was auctioned at Christie's. The leather-bound volume included the final shooting script and a carbon copy of \\\"American\\\" that bore handwritten annotations\\u2014purportedly made by Hearst's lawyers, who were said to have obtained it in the manner described by Kael in \\\"Raising Kane\\\". Estimated to bring $70,000 to $90,000, it sold for a record $231,000.\\nIn 2007, Welles's personal copy of the last revised draft of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" before the shooting script was sold at Sotheby's for $97,000. A second draft of the script titled \\\"American\\\", marked \\\"Mr. Welles' working copy\\\", was auctioned by Sotheby's in 2014 for $164,692. A collection of 24 pages from a working script found in Welles's personal possessions by his daughter Beatrice Welles was auctioned in 2014 for $15,000.\\nIn 2014, a collection of approximately 235 \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" stills and production photos that had belonged to Welles was sold at auction for $7,812.\\nRights and home media.\\nThe composited camera negative of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is believed to be lost forever. The most commonly-reported explanation is that it was destroyed in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. However, in 2021, Nicolas Falacci revealed that he had been told \\\"the real story\\\" by a colleague, when he was one of two employees in the film restoration lab which assembled the 1991 \\\"restoration\\\" from the best available elements. Falacci noted that throughout the process he had daily visits in 1990-1 from an unnamed \\\"older RKO executive showing up every day \\u2013 nervous and sweating\\\". According to Falacci's colleague, this elderly man was keen to cover up a clerical error he had made decades earlier when in charge of the studio's inventory, which had resulted in the original camera negatives being sent to a silver reclamation plant, destroying the nitrate film to extract its valuable silver content. Falacci's account is impossible to verify, but it would have been fully in keeping with industry standard practice for many decades, which was to destroy prints and negatives of countless older films deemed non-commercially viable, to extract the silver.\\nSubsequent prints were derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount Pictures released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6\\u00a0million in North America.\\nIn 1955, RKO sold the American television rights to its film library, including \\\"Citizen Kane\\\", to C&amp;C Television Corp. In 1960, television rights to the pre-1959 RKO's live-action library were acquired by United Artists. RKO kept the non-broadcast television rights to its library.\\nIn 1976, when home video was in its infancy, entrepreneur Snuff Garrett bought cassette rights to the RKO library for what United Press International termed \\\"a pittance\\\". In 1978 The Nostalgia Merchant released the film through Media Home Entertainment. By 1980 the 800-title library of The Nostalgia Merchant was earning $2.3\\u00a0million a year. \\\"Nobody wanted cassettes four years ago,\\\" Garrett told UPI. \\\"It wasn't the first time people called me crazy. It was a hobby with me which became big business.\\\" RKO Home Video released the film on VHS and Betamax in 1985.\\nIn 1984, The Criterion Collection released the film as its first LaserDisc. It was made from a fine grain master positive provided by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. When told about the then-new concept of having an audio commentary on the disc, Welles was skeptical but said \\\"theoretically, that's good for teaching movies, so long as they don't talk nonsense.\\\" In 1992 Criterion released a new 50th Anniversary Edition LaserDisc. This version had an improved transfer and additional special features, including the documentary \\\"The Legacy of Citizen Kane\\\" and Welles's early short \\\"The Hearts of Age\\\".\\nTurner Broadcasting System acquired broadcast television rights to the RKO library in 1986 and the full worldwide rights to the library in 1987. The RKO Home Video unit was reorganized into Turner Home Entertainment that year. In 1991 Turner released a 50th Anniversary Edition on VHS and as a collector's edition that includes the film, the documentary \\\"Reflections On Citizen Kane\\\", Harlan Lebo's 50th anniversary album, a poster and a copy of the original script. In 1996, Time Warner acquired Turner and Warner Home Video absorbed Turner Home Entertainment. In 2011 WarnerMedia's Warner Bros. unit had distribution rights for the film.\\nIn 2001, Warner Home Video released a 60th Anniversary Collectors Edition DVD. The two-disc DVD included feature-length commentaries by Roger Ebert and Peter Bogdanovich, as well as a second DVD with the feature length documentary \\\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\\" (1999). It was simultaneously released on VHS. The DVD was criticized for being \\\" bright, ; the dirt and grime had been cleared away, but so had a good deal of the texture, the depth, and the sense of film grain.\\\"\\nIn 2003, Welles's daughter Beatrice Welles sued Turner Entertainment, claiming the Welles estate is the legal copyright holder of the film. She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed to proceed with the lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.\\nIn 2011, it was released on Blu-ray and DVD in a 70th Anniversary Edition. The \\\"San Francisco Chronicle\\\" called it \\\"the Blu-ray release of the year.\\\" Supplements included everything available on the 2001 Warner Home Video release, including \\\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\\" DVD. A 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition added a third DVD with \\\"RKO 281\\\" (1999), an award winning TV movie about the making of the film. Its packaging extras included a hardcover book and a folio containing mini reproductions of the original souvenir program, lobby cards, and production memos and correspondence. The transfer for the US releases were scanned as 4K resolution from three different 35mm prints and rectified the quality issues of the 2001 DVD. The rest of the world continued to receive home video releases based on the older transfer. This was partially rectified in 2016 with the release of the 75th Anniversary Edition in both the UK and US, which was a straight repackaging of the main disc from the 70th Anniversary Edition.\\nOn August 11, 2021 Criterion announced their first 4K Ultra HD releases, a six-film slate, would include \\\"Citizen Kane\\\". Criterion indicated each title was to be available in a combo pack including a 4K UHD disc of the feature film as well as the film and special features on the companion Blu-rays. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" was released on November 23, 2021 by the collection as a 4K and 3 Blu-ray disc package. However, the release was recalled because at the half-hour mark on the regular blu-ray, the contrast fell sharply, which resulted in a much darker image compared to what was supposed to occur. However this issue does not apply to the 4K version itself.\\nColorization controversy.\\nIn the 1980s, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" became a catalyst in the controversy over the colorization of black-and-white films. One proponent of film colorization was Ted Turner, whose Turner Entertainment Company owned the RKO library. A Turner Entertainment spokesperson initially stated that \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" would not be colorized, but in July 1988 Turner said, \\\"\\\"Citizen Kane?\\\" I'm thinking of colorizing it.\\\" In early 1989 it was reported that two companies were producing color tests for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased when filmmaker Henry Jaglom stated that shortly before his death Welles had implored him \\\"don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons.\\\"\\nIn February 1989, Turner Entertainment President Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that \\\"could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate.\\\" Mayer added that Welles's contract was \\\"quite unusual\\\" and \\\"other contracts we have checked out are not like this at all.\\\" Turner had only colorized the final reel of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage was included in the BBC \\\"Arena\\\" documentary \\\"The Complete Citizen Kane\\\".\\nThe colorization controversy was a factor in the passage of the National Film Preservation Act in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year. ABC News anchor Peter Jennings reported that \\\"one major reason for doing this is to require people like the broadcaster Ted Turner, who's been adding color to some movies and re-editing others for television, to put notices on those versions saying that the movies have been altered\\\".\"}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Monty_Python's_Life_of_Brian\", \"label\": \"Film\", \"text\": \"Monty Python's Life of Brian, also known as Life of Brian, is a 1979 British comedy film starring and written by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin). It was directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish-Roman man who is born on the same day as\\u2014and next door to\\u2014Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.\\nFollowing the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, long-time Monty Python fan and former member of the Beatles, George Harrison, arranged financing for \\\"Life of Brian\\\" through the formation of his company HandMade Films.\\nThe film's themes of religious satire were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the United Kingdom either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate. Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, and in a few of these, such as Italy, bans lasted decades. The filmmakers used the notoriety to promote the film, with posters in Sweden reading, \\\"So funny, it was banned in Norway!\\\"\\nThe film was a box office success, the fourth-highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979, and highest grossing of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular and has been named as the greatest comedy film of all time by several magazines and television networks, and it later received a 95% \\\"Certified Fresh\\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus, \\\"One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.\\\" In a 2006 Channel 4 poll, \\\"Life of Brian\\\" was ranked first on their list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films.\\nPlot.\\nBrian Cohen is born in a stable next door to the one in which Jesus is born, which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future King of the Jews. Brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While listening to Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exaggerated by his mother revealing Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the \\\"People's Front of Judea\\\" (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering independence movements which spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.\\nBrian participates in an abortive attempt by the PFJ to kidnap the wife of Roman governor Pontius Pilate but is captured by the palace guards. Escaping when the guards suffer paroxysms of laughter over Pilate's speech impediment, Brian winds up trying to blend in among prophets preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus' sermons. He stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more. Brian grows frantic when people start following him and declare him to be the messiah. After spending a night in bed with Judith, Brian discovers an enormous crowd assembled outside his mother's house. Her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed, so she consents to Brian addressing them. He urges them to think for themselves, but they parrot his words as doctrine.\\nThe PFJ seeks to exploit Brian's celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding miracle cures. Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and is sentenced to crucifixion. In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice. The crowd shouts out names containing the letter \\\"r\\\", mocking Pilate's rhotacistic speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, and Pilate agrees to \\\"welease Bwian\\\".\\nHis order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film \\\"Spartacus\\\", various crucified people all claim to be \\\"Brian\\\" so they can be freed and the wrong man is released. Other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as the PFJ and then Judith praise his martyrdom, while his mother expresses regret for having raised him. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the \\\"Judean People's Front\\\" charges and prompts the Roman soldiers to flee; however, the squad commits mass suicide as a form of political protest. Condemned to a slow and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who cheerfully sing \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\\\"\\nCast.\\nSeveral characters remained unnamed during the film but do have names that are used in the soundtrack album track listing and elsewhere. There is no mention in the film that Eric Idle's ever-cheerful joker is called \\\"Mr Cheeky\\\", or that the Roman guard played by Michael Palin is named \\\"Nisus Wettus\\\".\\nSpike Milligan plays a prophet, ignored because his acolytes are chasing after Brian. By coincidence Milligan was visiting his old World War II battlefields in Tunisia where the film was being made. The Pythons were alerted to this one morning and he was promptly included in the scene being filmed. He disappeared in the afternoon before he could be included in any of the close-up or publicity shots for the film.\\nProduction.\\nPre-production.\\nThere are various stories about the origins of \\\"Life of Brian\\\". Shortly after the release of \\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\\" (1975), Eric Idle flippantly suggested that the title of the Pythons' forthcoming feature would be \\\"Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory\\\" (a play on the UK title for the 1970 American film \\\"Patton\\\"). This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed \\\"Holy Grail\\\"s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way that \\\"Holy Grail\\\" had lampooned Arthurian legend. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting \\\"Holy Grail\\\" in Amsterdam, had come up with a sketch in which Jesus' cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early brainstorming stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was \\\"definitely a good guy\\\" and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: \\\"He's not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff\\\", said Idle later. After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of \\\"the 13th disciple\\\". The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.\\nWriting.\\nThe first draft of the screenplay, provisionally titled \\\"The Gospel According to St. Brian\\\", was ready by Christmas 1976. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following \\\"a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados\\\". The film would not have been made without Python fan Beatle George Harrison, who set up HandMade Films to help fund it at a cost of \\u00a33\\u00a0million. Harrison put up the money for it as he \\\"wanted to see the movie\\\"\\u2014later described by Terry Jones as the \\\"world's most expensive cinema ticket.\\\"\\nThe original backers\\u2014EMI Films and, particularly, Bernard Delfont\\u2014had been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter. The very last words in the film are: \\\"I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'\\\", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, \\\"They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally.\\\" As a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, \\\"owner of the Mount\\\", who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:09 in the film). His one word of dialogue (a cheery but out of place Scouse \\\"'ullo\\\") had to be dubbed in later by Michael Palin.\\nFilming.\\nTerry Jones was solely responsible for directing, having amicably agreed with Gilliam (who co-directed \\\"Holy Grail\\\") to do so, with Gilliam concentrating on the look of the film. \\\"Holy Grail\\\"s production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera. Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of set design. However, this did not put an absolute end to their feuding. On the DVD commentary, Gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular, the main hall of Pilate's fortress, which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the Romans had converted by dumping their structural artefacts (such as marble floors and columns) on top. He reveals his consternation at Jones for not paying enough attention to it in the cinematography. Gilliam also worked on the matte paintings, useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a star-scape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti. Perhaps the most significant contribution from Gilliam was the scene in which Brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war. This was done \\\"in camera\\\" using a hand-built model starship and miniature pyrotechnics. Gilliam recounted in an interview:\\nWell, we didn't know what to do with Brian. He got himself to the top of the tower and we had to rescue him somehow, so I said, \\\"OK, spaceship for that.\\\" That was purely it. It was funny, because this was at the time when \\\"Star Wars\\\" had just come out. I remember meeting George Lucas at the baggage roundabout in the San Francisco airport, and I said, \\u201cThis was my chance to do a mini \\\"Star Wars\\\" episode.\\u201d\\nThe film was shot on location in Monastir, Tunisia, which allowed the production to reuse sets from Franco Zeffirelli's \\\"Jesus of Nazareth\\\" (1977). The Tunisian shoot was documented by Iain Johnstone for his BBC film \\\"The Pythons\\\". Many locals were employed as extras on \\\"Life of Brian\\\". Director Jones noted, \\\"They were all very knowing because they'd all worked for Franco Zeffirelli on \\\"Jesus of Nazareth\\\", so I had these elderly Tunisians telling me, 'Well, Mr Zeffirelli wouldn't have done it like that, you know.'\\\" Further location shooting also took place in Tunisia, at Sousse (Jerusalem outer walls and gateway), Carthage (Roman theatre) and Matmata (Sermon on the Mount and Crucifixion).\\nGraham Chapman, suffering from alcoholism, was so determined to play the lead role \\u2013 at one point coveted by Cleese \\u2013 that he dried out in time for filming, so much so that he also acted as the on-set doctor.\\nRough cut and pre-screenings.\\nFollowing shooting between 16 September and 12 November 1978, a two-hour rough cut of the film was put together for its first private showing in January 1979. Over the next few months \\\"Life of Brian\\\" was re-edited and re-screened a number of times for different preview audiences, losing a number of entire filmed sequences.\\nEditing.\\nA number of scenes were cut during the editing process. Five deleted scenes, a total of 13 minutes, including the controversial \\\"Otto\\\", were first made available in 1997 on the Criterion Collection Laserdisc. An unknown amount of raw footage was destroyed in 1998 by the company that bought Handmade Films. However, a number of them (of varying quality) were shown the following year on the Paramount Comedy Channel in the UK. The scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding Jesus's birth, which would have been at the very start of the film; a segment showing the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife (a large woman played by John Case) whose escape results in a fistfight; a scene introducing hardline Zionist Otto, leader of the Judean People's Front (played by Eric Idle) and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard; and a brief scene in which Judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help. The shepherds' scene has badly distorted sound, and the kidnap scene has poor colour quality. The same scenes that were on the Criterion laserdisc can now be found on the Criterion Collection DVD.\\nThe most controversial cuts were the scenes involving Otto, initially a recurring character, who had a thin Adolf Hitler moustache and spoke with a German accent, shouting accusations of \\\"racial impurity\\\" at Judeans who were conceived (as Brian was) when their mothers were raped by Roman centurions, as well as other Nazi phrases. The logo of the Judean People's Front, designed by Terry Gilliam, was a Star of David with a small line added to each point so it resembled a swastika, most familiar in the West as the symbol of the anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on Imperial German helmets. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto's dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in \\\"The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons\\\", said he thought it should have stayed, saying \\\"Listen, we've alienated the Christians, let's get the Jews now.\\\" Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; \\\"It's essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it's rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view.\\\" Michael Palin's personal journal entries from the period when various edits of \\\"Brian\\\" were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons' and filmmakers' concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film. However, Oxford Brookes University historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented \\\"a form of self-censorship\\\" and the Otto sequence \\\"which involved a character representative of extreme forms of Zionism\\\" was cut \\\"in the interests of smoothing the way for the film's distribution in America.\\\"\\nThe only scene with Otto that remains in the film is during the crucifixion sequence. Otto arrives with his \\\"crack suicide squad\\\", sending the Roman soldiers fleeing in terror. Instead of doing anything useful, they \\\"attack\\\" by committing mass suicide in front of the cross (\\\"Zat showed 'em, huh?\\\" says the dying Otto, to which Brian despondently replies \\\"You silly sods!\\\"), ending Brian's hope of rescue (they do however show some signs of life during the famous rendition of \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\\" when they are seen waving their toes in unison in time to the music). Terry Jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to continuity reasons, as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene. He acknowledged that some of the humour of this sole remaining contribution was lost through the earlier edits, but felt they were necessary to the overall pacing.\\nOtto's scenes, and those with Pilate's wife, were cut from the film after the script had gone to the publishers, and so they can be found in the published version of the script. Also present is a scene where, after Brian has led the Fifth Legion to the headquarters of the People's Front of Judea, Reg (John Cleese) says \\\"You cunt!! You stupid, bird-brained, flat-headed...\\\" The profanity was overdubbed to \\\"you klutz\\\" before the film was released. Cleese approved of this editing as he felt the reaction to the profanity would \\\"get in the way of the comedy.\\\"\\nAn early listing of the sequence of sketches reprinted in \\\"Monty Python: The Case Against\\\" by Robert Hewison reveals that the film was to have begun with a set of sketches at an English public school. Much of this material was first printed in the \\\"Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook\\\" that accompanied the original script publication of \\\"The Life of Brian\\\" and then subsequently reused. The song \\\"All Things Dull and Ugly\\\" and the parody scripture reading \\\"Martyrdom of St. Victor\\\" were performed on \\\"Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album\\\" (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in \\\"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\\\" (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased \\\"The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album\\\" (1981).\\nSoundtrack.\\nAn album was also released by Monty Python in 1979 in conjunction with the film. In addition to the \\\"Brian Song\\\" and \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\\", it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. The album opens with a brief rendition of \\\"Hava Nagila\\\" on Scottish bagpipes. A CD version was released in 1997.\\nAn album of the songs sung in \\\"Monty Python's Life of Brian\\\" was released on the Disky label. \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\\" was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British football fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the Falklands War when sailors aboard the destroyer HMS \\\"Sheffield\\\", severely damaged in an Argentinean Exocet missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue. Many people have come to see the song as a life-affirming ode to optimism. One of its more famous renditions was by the dignitaries of Manchester's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games, just after they were awarded to Sydney. Idle later performed the song as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\\" is also featured in Eric Idle's \\\"Spamalot\\\", a Broadway musical based upon \\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\\", and was sung by the rest of the Monty Python group at Graham Chapman's memorial service and at the \\\"Monty Python Live At Aspen\\\" special. The song is a staple at Iron Maiden concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.\\nRelease.\\nFor the original British and Australian releases, a spoof travelogue narrated by John Cleese, \\\"Away From It All\\\", was shown before the film itself. It consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from Cleese. For instance, a shot of Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment \\\"Hard to believe, isn't it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of Western Civilisation as we know it!\\\", Communist Bulgaria being a member of the Warsaw Pact at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues \\\"per se\\\", it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.\\n\\\"Life of Brian\\\" opened on 17 August 1979 in five North American theatres and grossed US$140,034 ($28,007 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total gross was $19,398,164. It was the highest grossing British film in North America that year. Released on 8 November 1979 in the UK, the film was the fourth highest-grossing film in Britain in 1979. In London, it opened at the Plaza cinema and grossed \\u00a340,470 in its opening week.\\nOn 30 April 2004, \\\"Life of Brian\\\" was re-released on five North American screens to \\\"cash in\\\" (as Terry Jones put it) on the box office success of Mel Gibson's \\\"The Passion of the Christ\\\". It grossed $26,376 ($5,275 per screen) in its opening weekend. It ran until October 2004, playing at 28 screens at its widest point, eventually grossing $646,124 during its re-release. By comparison, a re-release of \\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\\" had earned $1.8 million three years earlier. A DVD of the film was also released that year.\\nReception.\\nReviews from critics were mostly positive on the film's release. Movie historian Leonard Maltin reported that \\\"This will probably offend every creed and denomination equally, but it shouldn't. The funniest and most sustained feature from Britain's bad boys.\\\" Vincent Canby of \\\"The New York Times\\\" called the film \\\"the foulest-spoken biblical epic ever made, as well as the best-humored\\u2014a nonstop orgy of assaults, not on anyone's virtue, but on the funny bone. It makes no difference that some of the routines fall flat because there are always others coming along immediately after that succeed.\\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \\\"What's endearing about the Pythons is their good cheer, their irreverence, their willingness to allow comic situations to develop through a gradual accumulation of small insanities.\\\" Gene Siskel of the \\\"Chicago Tribune\\\" gave the film three and a half stars, calling it \\\"a gentle but very funny parody of the life of Jesus, as well as of biblical movies.\\\" Kevin Thomas of the \\\"Los Angeles Times\\\" declared, \\\"Even those of us who find Monty Python too hit-and-miss and gory must admit that its latest effort has numerous moments of hilarity.\\\" Clyde Jeavons of \\\"The Monthly Film Bulletin\\\" wrote that the script was \\\"occasionally over-raucous and crude,\\\" but found the second half of the film \\\"cumulatively hilarious,\\\" with \\\"a splendidly tasteless finale, which even Mel Brooks might envy.\\\" Gary Arnold of \\\"The Washington Post\\\" had a negative opinion of the film, writing that it was \\\"a cruel fiction to foster the delusion that 'Brian' is bristling with blasphemous nifties and throbbing with impious wit. If only it were! One might find it easier to keep from nodding off.\\\"\\nOver time, \\\"Life of Brian\\\" has regularly been cited as a significant contender for the title \\\"greatest comedy film of all time\\\", and has been named as such in polls conducted by \\\"Total Film\\\" magazine in 2000, the British TV network Channel 4 where it topped the poll in the 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and \\\"The Guardian\\\" in 2007. Rotten Tomatoes lists it as one of the best reviewed comedies, with a 95% approval rating from 61 published reviews. A 2011 poll by \\\"Time Out\\\" magazine ranked it as the third greatest comedy film ever made, behind \\\"Airplane!\\\" and \\\"This is Spinal Tap\\\".\\nThe BFI declared \\\"Life of Brian\\\" to be the 28th best British film of all time, in their equivalent of the original AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. It was the seventh highest ranking comedy on this list (four of the better placed efforts were classic Ealing Films). Another Channel 4 poll in 2001 named it the 23rd greatest film of all time (the only comedy that came higher was Billy Wilder's \\\"Some Like It Hot\\\", which was ranked 5th). In 2016, \\\"Empire\\\" magazine ranked \\\"Life of Brian\\\" 2nd in their list of the 100 best British films, with only David Lean\\u2019s \\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\\" ranking higher.\\nVarious polls have voted the line, \\\"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\\\" (spoken by Brian's mother Mandy to the crowd assembled outside her house), to be the funniest in film history. Other famous lines from the film have featured in polls, such as, \\\"What have the Romans ever done for us?\\\" and \\\"I'm Brian and so's my wife\\\".\\nBlasphemy accusations.\\nInitial criticism.\\nRichard Webster comments in \\\"A Brief History of Blasphemy\\\" (1990) that \\\"internalised censorship played a significant role in the handling\\\" of \\\"Monty Python's Life of Brian\\\". In his view, \\\"As a satire on religion, this film might well be considered a rather slight production. As blasphemy it was, even in its original version, extremely mild. Yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety, in some quarters of the Establishment, about the offence it might cause. As a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made. Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined to show it for fear of offending Christians in the UK. Once again a blasphemy was restrained \\u2013 or its circulation effectively curtailed \\u2013 not by the force of law but by the internalisation of this law.\\\" On its initial release in the UK, the film was banned by several town councils \\u2013 some of which had no cinemas within their boundaries, or had not even seen the film. A member of Harrogate council, one of those that banned the film, revealed during a television interview that the council had not seen the film, and had based their opinion on what they had been told by the Nationwide Festival of Light, a grouping with an evangelical Christian base, of which they knew nothing.\\nIn New York (the film's release in the US preceded British distribution), screenings were picketed by both rabbis and nuns (\\\"Nuns with banners!\\\" observed Michael Palin). It was also banned for eight years in Ireland and for a year in Norway (it was marketed in Sweden as \\\"The film so funny that it was banned in Norway\\\"). During the film's theatrical run in Finland, a text explaining that the film was a parody of Hollywood historical epics was added to the opening credits.\\nIn the UK, Mary Whitehouse, and other traditionalist Christians, pamphleteered and picketed locations where the local cinema was screening the film, a campaign that was felt to have boosted publicity. Leaflets arguing against the film's representation of the New Testament (for example, suggesting that the Wise Men would not have approached the wrong stable as they do in the opening of the film) were documented in Robert Hewison's book \\\"Monty Python: The Case Against\\\".\\nCrucifixion issue.\\nOne of the most controversial scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a \\\"Jolly Boys Outing\\\" (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: \\\"See, not so bad once you're up!\\\"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems. For example, when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, he replies: \\\"Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion\\\". In another example, Matthias, an old man who works with the People's Front of Judea, dismisses crucifixion as \\\"a doddle\\\" and says being stabbed would be worse.\\nThe director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: \\\"Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly.\\\" The Pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.\\nResponses from the cast.\\nShortly after the film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in a debate on the BBC2 discussion programme \\\"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\\\" with Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and Stockwood, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended that it was a send-up of Christ himself. Both Pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting Mother Teresa and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese stated that his reputation had \\\"plummeted\\\" in his eyes, while Palin commented, \\\"He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all.\\\" Muggeridge's verdict on the film was that it was \\\"Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn't possibly destroy anyone's genuine faith.\\\" In a 2013 interview on BBC Radio 4, Cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he \\\"was astonished, first of all, at how stupid [the two members of the Church] were, and how boring the debate became\\\". He added: \\\"I think the sad thing was that there was absolutely no attempt at a proper discussion \\u2013 no attempt to find any common ground.\\\"\\nThe Pythons unanimously deny that they were ever out to destroy people's faith. On the DVD audio commentary, they contend that the film is heretical because it lampoons the practices of modern organised religion, but that it does not blasphemously lampoon the God that Christians and Jews worship. When Jesus does appear in the film (on the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The music and lighting make it clear that there is a genuine aura around him. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love and tolerance (\\\"I think he said, 'blessed are the cheese makers'\\\"). Importantly, he is distinct from the character of Brian, which is also evident in the scene where an annoying and ungrateful ex-leper pesters Brian for money, while moaning that since Jesus cured him, he has lost his source of income in the begging trade (referring to Jesus as a \\\"bloody do-gooder\\\").\\nJames Crossley, however, has argued that the film makes the distinction between Jesus and the character of Brian to make a contrast between the traditional Christ of both faith and cinema and the historical figure of Jesus in critical scholarship and how critical scholars have argued that ideas later got attributed to Jesus by his followers. Crossley points out that the film uses the character of Brian to address a number of potentially controversial scholarly theories about Jesus, such as the Messianic Secret, the Jewishness of Jesus, Jesus the revolutionary, and having a single mother.\\nNot all the Pythons agree on the definition of the movie's tone. There was a brief exchange that occurred when the surviving members reunited in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998. In the section where \\\"Life of Brian\\\" is discussed, Terry Jones says, \\\"I think the film is heretical, but it's not blasphemous.\\\" Eric Idle can be heard to concur, adding, \\\"It's a heresy.\\\" However, John Cleese, disagreeing, counters, \\\"I don\\u2019t think it's a heresy. It's making fun of the way that people misunderstand the teaching.\\\" Jones responds, \\\"Of course it's a heresy, John! It's attacking the Church! And that has to be heretical.\\\" Cleese replies, \\\"No, it's not attacking the Church, necessarily. It's about people who cannot agree with each other.\\\"\\nIn a later interview, Jones said the film \\\"isn't blasphemous because it doesn\\u2019t touch on belief at all. It is heretical, because it touches on dogma and the interpretation of belief, rather than belief itself.\\\"\\n21st century.\\nThe film continues to cause controversy; in February 2007, the Church of St Thomas the Martyr in Newcastle upon Tyne held a public screening in the church itself, with song-sheets, organ accompaniment, stewards in costume and false beards for female members of the audience (alluding to an early scene where a group of women disguise themselves as men so that they are able to take part in a stoning). Although the screening was a sell-out, some Christian groups, notably the conservative Christian Voice, were highly critical of the decision to allow the screening to go ahead. Stephen Green, the head of Christian Voice, insisted that \\\"You don't promote Christ to the community by taking the mick out of him.\\\" The Reverend Jonathan Adams, one of the church's clergy, defended his taste in comedy, saying that it did not mock Jesus, and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion. Again on the film's DVD commentary, Cleese also spoke up for religious people who have come forward and congratulated him and his colleagues on the film's highlighting of double standards among purported followers of their own faith.\\nSome bans continued into the 21st century. In 2008, Torbay Council finally permitted the film to be shown after it won an online vote for the English Riviera International Comedy Film Festival. In 2009, it was announced that a thirty-year-old ban of the film in the Welsh town of Aberystwyth had finally been lifted, and the subsequent showing was attended by Terry Jones and Michael Palin alongside mayor Sue Jones-Davies (who portrayed Judith Iscariot in the film). However, before the showing, an Aberystwyth University student discovered that a ban had only been discussed by the council and in fact that it had been shown (or scheduled to be shown) at a cinema in the town in 1981. In 2013, a German official in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia considered the film to be possibly offensive to Christians and hence subject to a local regulation prohibiting its public screening on Good Friday, despite protests by local atheists.\\nPolitical satire.\\nThe film pokes fun at revolutionary groups and 1970s British left-wing politics. According to Roger Wilmut, \\\"What the film does do is place modern stereotypes in a historical setting, which enables it to indulge in a number of sharp digs, particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations\\\". The groups in the film all oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences. Such disunity indeed fatally beleaguered real-life Judean resistance against Roman rule. Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on \\\"modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas\\\".\\nThe People's Front of Judea, composed of the Pythons' characters, harangue their \\\"rivals\\\" with cries of \\\"splitters\\\" and stand vehemently opposed to the Judean People's Front, the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the Judean Popular Front (the last composed of a single old man, mocking the size of real revolutionary Trotskyist factions). The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle \\\"against the common enemy,\\\" the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, \\\"the Judean People's Front!\\\" However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.\\nOther scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. There is also a famous scene in which Reg gives a revolutionary speech asking, \\\"What have the Romans ever done for us?\\\" at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, public health and peace, followed by \\\"what have the Romans ever done for us except sanitation, medicine, education...\\\". Python biographer George Perry notes, \\\"The People's Liberation Front of Judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of shop stewards\\\". This joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the Babylonian Talmud; some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the Talmudic text.\\nFilm analysis.\\nThemes and motifs.\\nBible.\\nThe depictions of Jesus in two short scenes at the start of the film are strongly based on Christian iconography. The resistance fighters leave the Sermon on the Mount, which was a literal recital, angry because Jesus was too pacifistic for them. (\\\"Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo\\u2026\\\") In addition to the respectful depiction of Jesus, the film does not state that there is no God or that Jesus is not the son of God. The appearance of a leper, who says he was healed by Jesus, is in line with the Gospels and their reports about Jesus performing miracles.\\nAny direct reference to Jesus disappears after the introductory scenes, yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of Brian. Brian being a bastard of a Roman centurion could refer to the polemic legend that Jesus was the son of the Roman soldier Panthera. Disguised as a prophet, Brian talks about \\\"the lilies on the field\\\" and states more clearly, \\\"Don't pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself\\\": Brian incoherently repeats statements he heard from Jesus.\\nAnother significant figure in the film who is named in the Gospels is Pontius Pilate, who is humorously given rhotacism. Although there is a hint to Barabbas prior to the crucifixion, no character in \\\"Life of Brian\\\" bears any resemblances to Judas or Caiaphas. An anti-Semitic interpretation of the story is therefore excluded, according to scholars. The crucifixion scene, a central part of Christian iconography, is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film. It depicts historically accurate enactment of a routinely done mass crucifixion.\\nBelief and dogmatism.\\nThe intended subject of the satire was not Jesus and his teachings but religious dogmatism, according to film theorists and statements from Monty Python. This is made clear in the beginning of the film during the Sermon on the Mount. Not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what Jesus says, but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly. When Jesus said, \\\"blessed are the peacemakers\\\", the audience understands the phonetically similar word \\\"Cheesemakers\\\" and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and beatification of those who produce dairy products.\\n\\\"Life of Brian\\\" satirises, in the words of David Hume, the \\\"strong propensity of mankind to [believe in] the extraordinary and the marvellous\\\". When Brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd, they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere. In their need to submit to an authority, the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah. The faithful gather beneath Brian's window en masse to receive God's blessing. This is when Brian utters the main message of the film \\\"you don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves!\\\" Monty Python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practising Christians after the film was released.\\nAccording to Terry Jones, \\\"Life of Brian\\\" \\\"is not blasphemy but heresy\\\", because Brian contested the authority of the Church whereas the belief in God remained untouched. He goes on to mention that \\\"Christ [is] saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love, and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in His name because they can't agree on how He said it, or in what order He said it.\\\" The dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal, which Brian lost, is in the words of Terry Jones the \\\"history of the Church in three minutes.\\\" Kevin Shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious.\\nFor the most part, lost in the religious controversy was the film's mockery of factional dogmatism among left-wing parties. According to John Cleese, an almost unmanageable number of left-wing organisations and parties was formed back then in the United Kingdom. He said that it had been so important to each of them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent. In the film, rather than presenting a common front as their organisational names should imply, the leader of the People's Front of Judea makes it clear that their hate for the Judean Peoples's Front is greater than their hate for the Romans. They are so caught up in constant debates that the \\\"rather looney bunch of revolutionaries\\\" indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure. So, in the end, even though they have ample opportunity to rescue Brian, they instead leave Brian on the cross, thanking him for his sacrifice.\\nHardly mentioned in the discussion was the sideswipe at the women's movement, which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s. In accordance with the language of political activists, resistance fighter Stan wants to exercise \\\"his right as a man\\\" to be a woman. The group accepts him from that moment on as Loretta, because the right to give birth was not theirs to take. Also as a result from that, the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister.\\nIndividuality and meaninglessness.\\nOne of the most commented-upon scenes in the film is when Brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and don\\u2019t need to follow anybody. According to Edward Slowik, this is a rare moment in which Monty Python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly. \\\"Life of Brian\\\" accurately depicts the existentialist view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life.\\nBrian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre. He is honest to himself and others and lives an authentic life as best as he can. However, Brian is too na\\u00efve to be called a hero based on the ideas of Albert Camus. For Camus, the search for the meaning of one's own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world. The \\\"absurd hero\\\" rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals, although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run. Contrary to that, Brian isn\\u2019t able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore can\\u2019t triumph over it.\\nIn \\\"Monty Python and Philosophy\\\", Kevin Shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd, and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning. He points out that the second-last verse of the song the film finishes on, \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\\", expresses this message clearly:\\nShilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them. On this note, some people would claim that the film presents a nihilistic world view which contradicts any basis of religion. However, \\\"Life of Brian\\\" offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism, Shilbrack states in his text. He comments that \\\"religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you can't fight it.\\\"\\nLegacy.\\nLiterature.\\nSpin-offs include a script-book \\\"The Life of Brian of Nazareth\\\", which was printed back-to-back with \\\"MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK\\\" as a single book. The printing of this book also caused problems, due to rarely used laws in the United Kingdom against blasphemy, dictating what can and cannot be written about religion. The publisher refused to print both halves of the book, and original prints were by two companies.\\nJulian Doyle, the film's editor, wrote \\\"The Life of Brian/Jesus\\\", a book which not only describes the filmmaking and editing process but argues that it is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. In October 2008, a memoir by Kim \\\"Howard\\\" Johnson titled \\\"Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday: My Life with Brian\\\" was released. Johnson became friendly with the Pythons during the filming of \\\"Life of Brian\\\" and his notes and memories of the behind-the-scenes filming and make-up.\\nMusic.\\nWith the success of Eric Idle's musical retelling of \\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\\", called \\\"Spamalot\\\", Idle announced that he would be giving \\\"Life of Brian\\\" a similar treatment. The oratorio, called \\\"Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)\\\", was commissioned to be part of the festival called Luminato in Toronto in June 2007, and was written/scored by Idle and John Du Prez, who also worked with Idle on \\\"Spamalot\\\". \\\"Not the Messiah\\\" is a spoof of Handel's \\\"Messiah\\\". It runs approximately 50 minutes, and was conducted at its world premiere by Toronto Symphony Orchestra music director Peter Oundjian, who is Idle's cousin. \\\"Not the Messiah\\\" received its US premiere at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, New York. Oundjian and Idle joined forces once again for a double performance of the oratorio in July 2007.\\nOther media.\\nIn October 2011, BBC Four premiered the made-for-television comedy film \\\"Holy Flying Circus\\\", written by Tony Roche and directed by Owen Harris. The \\\"Pythonesque\\\" film explores the events surrounding the 1979 television debate on talk show \\\"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\\\" between John Cleese and Michael Palin and Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, then Bishop of Southwark.\\nIn a \\\"Not the Nine O'Clock News\\\" sketch, a bishop who has directed a scandalous film called \\\"The Life of Christ\\\" is hauled over the coals by a representative of the \\\"Church of Python\\\", claiming that the film is an attack on \\\"Our Lord, John Cleese\\\" and on the members of Python, who, in the sketch, are the objects of Britain's true religious faith. This was a parody of the infamous \\\"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\\\" programme, broadcast a week previously. The bishop (played by Rowan Atkinson) claims that the reaction to the film has surprised him, as he \\\"didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.\\\"\\nRadio host John Williams of Chicago's WGN 720 AM has used \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\\" in a segment of his Friday shows. The segment is used to highlight good events from the past week in listeners' lives and what has made them smile. In the 1997 film \\\"As Good as It Gets\\\", the misanthropic character played by Jack Nicholson sings \\\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\\" as evidence of the character's change in attitude.\\nA BBC history series \\\"What the Romans Did for Us\\\", written and presented by Adam Hart-Davis and broadcast in 2000, takes its title from Cleese's rhetorical question \\\"What have the Romans ever done for us?\\\" in one of the film's scenes. (Cleese himself parodied this line in a 1986 BBC advert defending the Television Licence Fee: \\\"What has the BBC ever given us?\\\").\\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair in his Prime Minister's Questions of 3 May 2006 made a shorthand reference to the types of political groups, \\\"Judean People's Front\\\" or \\\"People's Front of Judea\\\", lampooned in \\\"Life of Brian\\\". This was in response to a question from the Labour MP David Clelland, asking \\\"What has the Labour government ever done for us?\\\" \\u2013 itself a parody of John Cleese's \\\"What have the Romans ever done for us?\\\"\\nOn New Year's Day 2007, and again on New Year's Eve, UK television station Channel 4 dedicated an entire evening to the Monty Python phenomenon, during which an hour-long documentary was broadcast called \\\"The Secret Life of Brian\\\" about the making of \\\"The Life of Brian\\\" and the controversy that was caused by its release. The Pythons featured in the documentary and reflected upon the events that surrounded the film. This was followed by a screening of the film itself. The documentary (in a slightly extended form) was one of the special features on the 2007 DVD re-release \\u2013 the \\\"Immaculate Edition\\\", also the first Python release on Blu-ray.\\nMost recently, in June 2014 King's College London hosted an academic conference on the film, in which internationally renowned Biblical scholars and historians discussed the film and its reception, looking both at how the Pythons had made use of scholarship and texts, and how the film can be used creatively within modern scholarship on the Historical Jesus. In a panel discussion, including Terry Jones and theologian Richard Burridge, John Cleese described the event as \\\"the most interesting thing to come out of Monty Python\\\". The papers from the conference have gone on to prompt the publication of a book, edited by Joan E. Taylor, the conference organiser, \\\"Jesus and Brian: Exploring the Historical Jesus and His Times via Monty Python's Life of Brian\\\", published by Bloomsbury in 2015.\"}\n",
