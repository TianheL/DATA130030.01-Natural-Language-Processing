# DATA130030.01-Natural-Language-Processing
This is a repository including all my projects in 2023 Spring Natural Language Processing (DATA130030.01) in School of Data Science, Fudan University. 

## Assignment1
1) explore Wikipedia text data
2) build language models
3) build a Naive Bayes classifier 

## Assignment2
1) Train word embeddings using SGNS
2) Find similar/dissimilar word pairs
3) Present a document as an embedding
4) Build classifier to test docs
5) Use t-SNE to project doc vectors

## Assignment3
1) explore two taggers for a Brown corpus.
2) Build a baseline method, namely, the most frequent tagger
3) Build an HMM tagger

## Final PJ
1) Option 1: Aspect Based Sentiment analysis
2) Option 2&3: Commonsense Validation and Explanation
3) Option 4: Fake News Challenge
4) You are free to choose other tasks related to natural language processing if you are not interested in the above tasks.
5) We choose option4, and propose a two stage model which use extractive summarization technique based on Sentence-BERT and two Roberta models combining hand-crafted feature.
